First, you can add a comma after ""syntax"" to separate the two clauses in the following sentence: ""In one sense, the ambiguity of Intel syntax (due to the absence of an official Intel assembly syntax manual) is the problem."" This will make it clear that ""due to the absence of an official Intel assembly syntax manual"" is a dependent clause that modifies ""Intel syntax.""

Next, you can add a comma after ""ad-hoc"" to separate another two clauses in this sentence: ""For decades, many assemblers have been developed ad-hoc without any standards."" This will help to distinguish the dependent clause ""without any standards"" from the independent clause ""many assemblers have been developed ad-hoc."" 

Finally, you can add a comma after ""Clang"" in the following sentence: ""On the other hand, Clang need to handle both two cases."" This will help to clarify the structure of this sentence as well as the next one that follows it.

In your paragraph, there are a few places where commas could be added or omitted to improve the clarity of the writing. Here are my suggestions:

2. In the second sentence, place a comma after ""assemblers"" to separate two independent clauses. The revised sentence would be: ""For decades, many assemblers have been developed ad-hoc, without any standards.""

4. In the fourth sentence, change ""both two"" to ""both of these"" to improve the clarity of the sentence. Additionally, insert a comma after ""Clang"" to separate the independent clauses in the sentence.

It's important to eliminate any clichés or overused phrases that might detract from the reader's interest. Make sure your language is specific and conveys the intended meaning in a clear manner.

this is it.
can you give an advice to improve my essay?
","Great job on revising your essay! Here are a few suggestions to improve it further:

1. Consider adding a clear thesis statement at the end of your introduction paragraph. This statement should provide a concise summary of your arguments and clearly state your stance on the question posed. An example thesis statement for your essay might be: ""While it may seem logical to provide aid only to those most in need, doing so can be discriminatory and demotivating. A more equitable approach is to provide aid to all citizens in need.""

2. Try to incorporate more concrete examples and evidence to support your arguments. For instance, you could provide examples of situations where people might intentionally misrepresent their situation in order to get assistance or discuss real-world instances of discrimination between groups that result from aid programs only targeting those most in need. This can help make your arguments more persuasive and relatable.

3. Consider adding some counterarguments and addressing them in your essay. For instance, some people might argue that focusing government assistance on the neediest can help maximize the impact of limited resources and ensure that aid goes to those who need it most. By discussing these counterarguments and explaining why you don't think they are as viable as your own arguments, you can strengthen your essay and show that you have considered multiple perspectives.

In this essay is there any grammatically wrong part?","Yes, there are a few grammatical errors in the essay. Let's work on revising them step by step.

First, let's look at this sentence: <sent>""Therefore, the question arises: should the government help only those most in need rather than helping all of its citizens?""</sent> There's a small error in subject-verb agreement. It should be, <sent>""should the government help only those most in need rather than help all of its citizens?"" </sent>

Next, in the sentence, <sent>""While it may seem logical to provide aid only to those most in need, doing so can be discriminatory and demotivating.""</sent> Replace the word 'doing' with 'it' to make it more clear.

The sentence, <sent>""If people in need only gets benefit from them, then people who don't get benefit will loose their motivation to pay tax""</sent> has a couple of issues. First, 'gets' should be 'get' to match the subject. Secondly, 'loose' is a spelling error - it should be spelled 'lose'. The sentence can be revised as <sent>""If people in need only get benefit from the government, then those who don't receive benefits will lose their motivation to pay taxes.""</sent>

The sentence, <sent>""Third problem of implementing a system of aid that targets only those most in need is that the process of determining who qualifies for aid can be highly subjective and subject to abuse""</sent> can be revised as <sent>""A third problem of implementing a system of aid that targets only those most in need is that the process of determining who qualifies for aid can be highly subjective and prone to abuse.""</sent>

Finally, in the sentence <sent>""For these reason the government should not help only those most in need,""</sent> 'reason' should be pluralized to match the sentence. It should be revised to: <sent>""For these reasons, the government should not help only those most in need.""</sent>

Let's review the revised version of the entire paragraph: 

<essay>The government makes laws and protects its citizens from various problems, such as disasters, poverty, and crime. Citizens have their rights to be helped and protected by the government. Each citizen has different situations and needs that may require assistance from the government. Therefore, the question arises: should the government help only those most in need rather than help all of its citizens? I want to say 'no' to this question for several reasons. While it may seem logical to provide aid only to those most in need, it can be discriminatory and demotivating. A more equitable approach is to provide aid to all citizens in need.

Firstly, if we help only people in need, discrimination and animosity between groups who receive benefits and who do not will deepen. The government governs the country with money from its citizens. Every rule and system is possible only when there is money to make and operate it. If only those in need receive benefits, those who do not may lose their motivation to pay taxes and may discriminate against those who benefit.

The second reason is that people may lose their motivation to work if the government provides assistance to only those in need. They may believe they do not need to work as they can rely on the government for money. In such a system, those who do not benefit from government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful towards those who do. They are faced with paying for the income of others without receiving any benefits themselves. As a result, their motivation to work decreases.

A third problem of implementing a system of aid that targets only those most in need is that the process of determining who qualifies for aid can be highly subjective and prone to abuse. Determining who qualifies for government aid and who does not can be complex and time-consuming. Some people might intentionally misrepresent their situation to receive assistance, while others might be unjustly excluded from aid due to administrative errors. There are also moral issues where people with greater resources may still qualify for government support due to errors in determining who qualifies for aid.

For these reasons, the government should not help only those most in need. Discrimination between two groups will grow, and people will not work hard to earn money. In addition, in reality, it is hard to implement a system of aid that targets only those most in need. All citizens have the right to be helped by their government, and helping everyone equally is a healthy approach for our society.</essay>",5,R Language Use,"    The government makes laws and protects its citizens from various problems, such as disasters, poverty, and crime.

They may argue that only students who demonstrate financial need or who contribute to the public good or a particular industry should be eligible for government funding.

 I changed like this, anyway to improve it?
","Great job! Here are some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consider moving the example about healthcare to a new paragraph, so that your first paragraph remains focused on your argument that limiting assistance to only those in need can create deeper discrimination and hatred between groups.

2. To enhance your second paragraph, consider providing specific examples of assistance programs that are currently in place and provide benefits only to those in need. You can then explain how these programs might disincentivize work and create resentment among those who don't receive benefits. You could also provide examples of programs that provide assistance to all citizens, such as public education and healthcare, and discuss how these programs foster a sense of community and shared responsibility.

3. Consider addressing the counterargument in a more comprehensive way. Instead of just mentioning that some people may argue that assistance to those in need is more efficient, you can provide more detail about this perspective and why some may feel this way. You can then refute this argument by presenting evidence or logical arguments to support your own stance.

Here is a revised version of the paragraph:

<essay>First, limiting assistance to only those in need can create deeper discrimination and antagonism between groups. The government runs the country with tax money collected from its citizens. If only those in need receive benefits, it can create resentment among those who do not receive aid.

Second, providing assistance only to those in need may disincentivize work and create resentment among those who do not qualify for aid. In such a system, individuals who do not benefit from government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful toward those who do. They are faced with paying for the income of others without receiving any benefits themselves, dampening their motivation to work. While some might argue that concentrating resources where they are most needed creates efficiency and reduces costs, those who are ineligible for assistance may feel left out of important government programs.

 now where should i touch?
can you help me change first-person, second-person structure to third-person structure?","Sure, changing to a third-person structure can make the essay more objective. Here's an example:

<essay>The relationship between government and citizens is a complex interplay of power, responsibility, and accountability. Citizens have the right to receive help and protection from the government, but circumstances vary, and each citizen may require assistance. Therefore, the question arises: Should the government help only those most in need, or should it provide aid to all citizens? This essay argues that the government should provide aid to all citizens, regardless of their financial situation or demonstrated needs, for several reasons. Firstly, limiting assistance only to those in need can lead to discrimination and division among groups. Secondly, it can demotivate people from working and thus hinder economic growth. Thirdly, it creates a system that is prone to errors and fraud. Finally, providing support to all citizens can promote social cohesion and a sense of responsibility.

The first reason is that limiting assistance to those in need can create deeper discrimination and antagonism between groups. The government runs the country with tax money collected from its citizens. If only those in need receive benefits, it can create resentment among those who do not receive aid. Discrimination and stigmatization can arise, leading those who do not receive assistance to harbor ill will towards those who do. For instance, when healthcare systems concentrate care only on those who demonstrate financial need, it can create division and hatred. On the other hand, when assistance is offered to all citizens, accountability is shared, and it fosters a sense of communal responsibility. Citizens are more invested in each other's well-being, leading to a more cohesive society.

The second reason is that offering assistance only to those in need can demotivate people from working. Those who do not qualify for government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful towards those who do. They pay for others' income without receiving any benefits themselves, which may decrease their motivation to work. While some argue that providing aid exclusively to those most in need can lead to greater efficiency, as resources are concentrated where they are most needed, limiting assistance to some citizens due to financial standing may lead them to question the fairness of the system. It may cause them to lose their reason to pay taxes and their motivation to work hard, resulting in a less efficient system overall.

The third issue of implementing a system that targets only those most in need of assistance is that it can be highly subjective and prone to abuse. Determining who qualifies for government aid and who does not can be complex and time-consuming. Some may intentionally misrepresent their situation to receive aid, while others might be unjustly excluded from assistance due to administrative errors. Additionally, those with greater resources might not require government support, yet may still benefit from it in various ways due to errors in determining qualifications for government aid.

Another reason is that providing financial aid only to those who demonstrate financial need can create unintended consequences, such as discouraging students from pursuing their preferred courses of study based on cost. In contrast, a system promoting assistance for all citizens, based on merit and academic achievement, ensures that talented students have equal opportunities to achieve their goals, which keeps the workforce competitive. While some argue that providing financial assistance to all students based on merit is a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars and that only those who demonstrate financial need or contribute to the public good should receive government funding, such limitation may exclude many talented students from accessing higher education, contributing to a less productive and innovative society overall. Therefore, the cost to the taxpayer must be weighed against the benefits of investing in a more educated citizenry.

In conclusion, aid should be provided to all citizens to ensure a just and cohesive society. Providing assistance only to those most in need can intensify discrimination and breed resentment, ultimately eroding social solidarity. Additionally, such a system may disincentivize work by fostering resentment among those who do not qualify for aid. While some may argue that focusing aid exclusively on those most in need may lead to greater efficiency, such a system can exclude those who may still require financial support. The process of determining who qualifies for aid can be complex and prone to errors, potentially leaving out deserving citizens. Offering aid to all citizens promotes social responsibility, while encouraging productivity and innovation. To build equity and community investment, the government must design aid programs that promote both inclusivity and efficiency by supporting all its citizens.</essay>",5,R Revision,"    The relationship between the government and its citizens is a complex interplay of power, responsibility, and accountability. Citizens have their rights to be helped and protected by government. Additionally, each citizen has different situations and needs that may require assistance from the government. Therefore, the question arises: should the government help only those most in need rather than help all of its citizens? This essay argues that the government should provide aid to all citizens, regardless of their financial status or demonstrated need, for several reasons; While it may seem logical to provide aid only to those most in need, it can be discriminatory and demotivating. Also, it creates a system that is prone to errors and fraud. Providing support to all citizens can promote social cohesion and responsibility. A more equitable approach is to provide aid to all citizens in need.

    First, limiting assistance to only those in need can create deeper discrimination and antagonism between groups. The government runs the country with tax money collected from its citizens. If only those in need receive benefits, it can create resentment among those who do not receive aid. Discrimination and stigmatization can arise, leading those who do not receive assistance to harbor ill will towards those who do. For example, when healthcare systems focus only on providing care to those who demonstrate financial need, it can create division and hatred. On the other hand, when assistance is provided to all citizens, accountability is shared and it fosters a sense of communal responsibility. Citizens are more invested in each other's well-being, leading to a more cohesive society.
 
   The second reason is that people will lose their motivation to work if the government provides assistance to only those in need. They just have to get money from government and live with it. In such a system, those who do not benefit from government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful towards those who do. They're faced with paying for the income of others without receiving any benefits themselves. As a result, their motivation to work decreases.
Some people might say that providing assistance only to those in need has potential for greater efficiency, as resources are concentrated where they are most needed. Additionally, the amount of funding needed for assistance programs may be lower, as it is targeted towards those in dire circumstances. However, Those who are ineligible for assistance due to their financial standing may feel that they are being left out of important government programs. They will lose their reason to pay taxes and their motivation to work hard, and consequently, government will lose efficiency gained by helping only those in need.

   A third problem of implementing a system of aid that targets only those most in need is that the process of determining who qualifies for aid can be highly subjective and prone to abuse. Determining who qualifies for government aid and who does not can be complex and time-consuming. Some people might intentionally misrepresent their situation in order to get assistance, while others might be unjustly excluded from aid due to administrative errors. Then there can be a moral issues. People with greater resources might not need government support, they may still benefit from it in various ways due to the error on determining who qualifies for government assistance.
   
    Another reason is that providing financial aid only to those who demonstrate financial need can create unintended consequences, such as discouraging students from pursuing their preferred paths of study based on cost. In contrast, a system that promotes providing assistance to all citizens based on merit and academic achievement ensures talented students have an equal opportunity to achieve their goals, thereby keeping the workforce competitive. Some argue that providing financial assistance to all students based on merit is a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars and that only those who demonstrate financial need or contribute to the public good should receive government funding. However, this argument fails to consider that limiting funding exclusively in this way may exclude many talented students from access to higher education, contributing to a less productive and innovative society overall. The cost to the taxpayer must be weighed against the benefits of investing in a more educated citizenry.
    
    In conclusion, the government must offer aid to all citizens to ensure a just and cohesive society. Providing assistance only to those most in need can intensify discrimination and breed resentment, ultimately eroding social solidarity. Additionally, such a system may disincentivize work by fostering resentment among those who do not qualify for aid. While some may argue that focusing aid only on those most in need can be more efficient, it can also exclude those who, despite not demonstrating obvious financial hardship, still require support. The process of determining who qualifies for aid can be complex and prone to errors, potentially leaving out deserving citizens. A system that promotes aid to all citizens is more inclusive and promotes social responsibility, while encouraging productivity and innovation. Therefore, it is imperative that the government consider equity and community investment when designing aid programs, rather than concentrating support on an exclusive group of people.","    The relationship between the government and its citizens is a complex interplay of power, responsibility, and accountability.

     First, limiting assistance to those in need can create deeper discrimination and antagonism between groups. The government runs the country with tax money collected from its citizens. If only those in need receive benefits, it can create resentment among those who do not receive aid. Discrimination and stigmatization can arise, leading those who do not receive assistance to harbor ill will towards those who do. For instance, when healthcare systems concentrate care only on those who demonstrate financial need, it can create division and hatred. On the other hand, when assistance is offered to all citizens, accountability is shared, and it fosters a sense of communal responsibility. Citizens are more invested in each other's well-being, leading to a more cohesive society.
 
   The second reason is that people will lose their motivation to work if the government provides assistance to only those in need. They just have to get money from government and live with it. In such a system, those who do not benefit from government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful towards those who do. They're faced with paying for the income of others without receiving any benefits themselves. As a result, their motivation to work decreases.
Some people might say that providing assistance only to those in need has potential for greater efficiency, as resources are concentrated where they are most needed. Additionally, the amount of funding needed for assistance programs may be lower, as it is targeted towards those in dire circumstances. However, Those who are ineligible for assistance due to their financial standing may feel that they are being left out of important government programs. They will lose their reason to pay taxes and their motivation to work hard, and consequently, government will lose efficiency gained by helping only those in need.

   A third problem of implementing a system of aid that targets only those most in need is that the process of determining who qualifies for aid can be highly subjective and prone to abuse. Determining who qualifies for government aid and who does not can be complex and time-consuming. Some people might intentionally misrepresent their situation in order to get assistance, while others might be unjustly excluded from aid due to administrative errors. Then there can be a moral issues. People with greater resources might not need government support, they may still benefit from it in various ways due to the error on determining who qualifies for government assistance.
   
    Another reason is that providing financial aid only to those who demonstrate financial need can create unintended consequences, such as discouraging students from pursuing their preferred paths of study based on cost. In contrast, a system that promotes providing assistance to all citizens based on merit and academic achievement ensures talented students have an equal opportunity to achieve their goals, thereby keeping the workforce competitive. Some argue that providing financial assistance to all students based on merit is a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars and that only those who demonstrate financial need or contribute to the public good should receive government funding. However, this argument fails to consider that limiting funding exclusively in this way may exclude many talented students from access to higher education, contributing to a less productive and innovative society overall. The cost to the taxpayer must be weighed against the benefits of investing in a more educated citizenry.
    
    In conclusion, the government must offer aid to all citizens to ensure a just and cohesive society. Providing assistance only to those most in need can intensify discrimination and breed resentment, ultimately eroding social solidarity. Additionally, such a system may disincentivize work by fostering resentment among those who do not qualify for aid. While some may argue that focusing aid only on those most in need can be more efficient, it can also exclude those who, despite not demonstrating obvious financial hardship, still require support. The process of determining who qualifies for aid can be complex and prone to errors, potentially leaving out deserving citizens. A system that promotes aid to all citizens is more inclusive and promotes social responsibility, while encouraging productivity and innovation. Therefore, it is imperative that the government consider equity and community investment when designing aid programs, rather than concentrating support on an exclusive group of people.</essay>

This essay argues that the government should provide aid to all citizens, regardless of their financial status or demonstrated need, for several reasons; While it may seem logical to provide aid only to those most in need, it can be discriminatory and demotivating. Also, it creates a system that is prone to errors and fraud. Providing support to all citizens can promote social cohesion and responsibility. A more equitable approach is to provide aid to all citizens, regardless of financial status or demonstrated need.

     First, limiting assistance to those in need can create deeper discrimination and antagonism between groups. The government runs the country with tax money collected from its citizens. If only those in need receive benefits, it can create resentment among those who do not receive aid. Discrimination and stigmatization can arise, leading those who do not receive assistance to harbor ill will towards those who do. For instance, when healthcare systems concentrate care only on those who demonstrate financial need, it can create division and hatred. On the other hand, when assistance is offered to all citizens, accountability is shared, and it fosters a sense of communal responsibility. Citizens are more invested in each other's well-being, leading to a more cohesive society.
 
   The second reason is that people will lose their motivation to work if the government provides assistance to only those in need. They could become reliant on government aid and lose motivation to work. In such a system, those who do not benefit from government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful towards those who do. Those who do not receive aid may feel as though they are contributing to support others without receiving any support themselves. As a result, their motivation to work decreases. Some people might say that providing assistance only to those in need has potential for greater efficiency, as resources are concentrated where they are most needed. Additionally, the amount of funding needed for assistance programs may be lower, as it is targeted towards those in dire circumstances. However, Those who are ineligible for assistance due to their financial standing may feel that they are being left out of important government programs. They will lose their reason to pay taxes and their motivation to work hard, and consequently, government will lose efficiency gained by helping only those in need.

   A third problem of implementing a system of aid that targets only those most in need is that the process of determining who qualifies for aid can be highly subjective and prone to abuse. Determining who qualifies for government aid and who does not can be complex and time-consuming. Some people might intentionally misrepresent their situation in order to get assistance, while others might be unjustly excluded from aid due to administrative errors. Then there can be a moral issues. People with greater resources might not need government support, they may still benefit from it in various ways due to the error on determining who qualifies for government assistance.
   
    Another reason is that providing financial aid only to those who demonstrate financial need can create unintended consequences, such as discouraging students from pursuing their preferred paths of study based on cost. In contrast, a system that promotes providing assistance to all citizens based on merit and academic achievement ensures talented students have an equal opportunity to achieve their goals, thereby keeping the workforce competitive. Some argue that providing financial assistance to all students based on merit is a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars and that only those who demonstrate financial need or contribute to the public good should receive government funding. However, this argument fails to consider that limiting funding exclusively in this way may exclude many talented students from access to higher education, contributing to a less productive and innovative society overall. The cost to the taxpayer must be weighed against the benefits of investing in a more educated citizenry.
    
    In conclusion, the government must offer aid to all citizens to ensure a just and cohesive society. Providing assistance only to those most in need can intensify discrimination and breed resentment, ultimately eroding social solidarity. Additionally, such a system may disincentivize work by fostering resentment among those who do not qualify for aid. While some may argue that focusing aid only on those most in need can be more efficient, it can also exclude those who, despite not demonstrating obvious financial hardship, still require support. The process of determining who qualifies for aid can be complex and prone to errors, potentially leaving out deserving citizens. A system that promotes aid to all citizens is more inclusive and promotes social responsibility, while encouraging productivity and innovation. Therefore, it is imperative that the government consider equity and community investment when designing aid programs, rather than concentrating support on an exclusive group of people.","    The relationship between the government and its citizens is a complex interplay of power, responsibility, and accountability.

Therefore, it is imperative that the government consider equity and community investment when designing aid programs, rather than concentrating support on an exclusive group of people.</essay>

I learned about adjective and adverb clauses, is there any wrong part with this subject?","Your essay is mostly grammatically correct. However, I did notice a few areas where you could improve your use of adjective and adverb clauses:

First, there is a sentence that could be made clearer by using an adjective clause. In the sentence <sent>""Those who do not receive aid may feel as though they are contributing to support others without receiving any support themselves,""</sent> you could use the relative pronoun ""who"" to form an adjective clause and make the sentence more concise: <sent>""Those who do not receive aid may feel as though they are contributing to support others who are receiving aid, without receiving any support themselves.""</sent>

Additionally, in the following sentence, you could improve your use of an adverb clause: <sent>""The government runs the country with tax money collected from its citizens.""</sent> Instead of simply stating this fact as a independent clause, you could use an adverb clause of manner to describe how the government runs the country: <sent>""The government runs the country with careful management of tax money.""</sent>

Lastly, check to make sure that your use of adjective and adverb clauses is appropriate in the context of your essay. It's important to make sure that the use enhances the meaning of the sentence rather than making it more confusing.

Overall, great job on the essay!",5,R Language Use,"The relationship between the government and its citizens is a complex interplay of power, responsibility, and accountability. The government is responsible for providing its citizens with assistance and protection as a fundamental right. Additionally, each citizen has different circumstances and needs that may require assistance from the government. Therefore, the question arises: should the government help only those most in need rather than help all of its citizens? This essay argues that the government should provide aid to all citizens, regardless of their financial status or demonstrated need, for several reasons; While it may seem logical to provide aid only to those most in need, it can be discriminatory and demotivating. Also, it creates a system that is prone to errors and fraud. Providing support to all citizens can promote social cohesion and responsibility. A more equitable approach is to provide aid to all citizens, regardless of financial status or demonstrated need.

     First, By restricting aid to those who demonstrate financial need, the government runs the risk of perpetuating division and animosity among different social and economic groups.The government runs the country with tax money collected from its citizens. If only those in need receive benefits, it can create resentment among those who do not receive aid. Discrimination and stigmatization can arise, leading those who do not receive assistance to harbor ill will towards those who do. For instance, when healthcare systems concentrate care only on those who demonstrate financial need, it can create division and hatred. On the other hand, when assistance is offered to all citizens, accountability is shared, and it fosters a sense of communal responsibility. Citizens are more invested in each other's well-being, leading to a more cohesive society.
 
   The second reason is that people will lose their motivation to work if the government provides assistance to only those in need. They could become reliant on government aid and lose motivation to work. In such a system, those who do not benefit from government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful towards those who do. Those who do not receive aid may feel as though they are contributing to support others without receiving any support themselves. As a result, their motivation to work decreases. Some people might say that providing assistance only to those in need has potential for greater efficiency, as resources are focused where they are most needed. Additionally, the amount of funding needed for assistance programs may be lower, as it is targeted towards those in dire circumstances. However, Those who are ineligible for assistance due to their financial standing may feel that they are being left out of important government programs. They will lose their reason to pay taxes and their motivation to work hard, and consequently, government will lose efficiency gained by helping only those in need.

   A third problem of implementing a system of aid that targets only those most in need is that the process of determining who qualifies for aid can be highly subjective and prone to abuse. Determining who qualifies for government aid and who does not can be complex and time-consuming. Some people might intentionally misrepresent their circumstance in order to get assistance, while others might be unjustly excluded from aid due to administrative errors. Then there can be a moral issues. People with greater resources might not need government support, they may still benefit from it in various ways due to the error on determining who qualifies for government assistance.
   
    Another reason is that providing financial aid only to those who demonstrate financial need can create unintended consequences, such as discouraging students from pursuing their preferred paths of study based on cost. In contrast, a system that promotes providing assistance to all citizens based on merit and academic achievement guarantees talented students have an equal opportunity to achieve their goals, thereby keeping the workforce competitive. Some argue that providing financial assistance to all students based on merit is a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars and that only those who demonstrate financial need or contribute to the public good should receive government funding. However, this argument fails to consider that limiting funding exclusively in this way may exclude many talented students from access to higher education, contributing to a less productive and innovative society overall. The cost to the taxpayer must be weighed against the benefits of investing in a more educated citizenry.
    
    In conclusion, the government must offer aid to all citizens to secure a just and cohesive society. Providing assistance only to those most in need can escalate discrimination and breed resentment, ultimately eroding social solidarity. Additionally, such a system may disincentivize work by fostering resentment among those who do not qualify for aid. While some may argue that focusing aid only on those most in need can be more efficient, it can also exclude those who, despite not demonstrating obvious financial hardship, still require support. The process of determining who qualifies for aid can be complex and prone to errors, potentially leaving out deserving citizens. A system that promotes aid to all citizens is more comprehensive and promotes social responsibility, while encouraging productivity and innovation. Therefore, it is imperative that the government consider equity and community investment when designing aid programs, rather than concentrating support on an exclusive group of people.

- Instead of using ""those"" repeatedly to refer to a group of people, consider using more precise language. For example, you could use ""individuals"" or ""recipients"" instead.

- Use a range of sentence structures to show your mastery of the English language. Try varying the length and complexity of your sentences, and use more sophisticated connectives such as ""moreover"" or ""nevertheless"" to link your ideas.

- Use more formal language where appropriate. For example, instead of saying ""citizens have different circumstances and needs,"" you could say ""citizens possess diverse circumstances and requirements.""

- Use adjective clauses to provide additional information about a noun. For instance, instead of saying ""when healthcare systems concentrate care only on those who demonstrate financial need,"" you could say ""when healthcare systems focus care only on those individuals who exhibit dire financial need.""

- Similarly, use adverb clauses to provide additional information about how, when, or why an action is taking place. For example, instead of saying ""The cost to the taxpayer must be weighed against the benefits of investing in a more educated citizenry,"" you could say ""As a result, the cost to the taxpayer must be carefully balanced against the important benefits of promoting a more educated citizenry.""

To begin with, people of lower classes tend to have poorer education. University these days has become extremely expensive and not all families can provide funds for their children to continue with their studies. We can extimate an average of 500$ spent in a semester only in books and class utilities. This represents a big portion of a wage for people with financial difficulties. That is why governament should help them achieve a better education with scholarships and funds. People with high socioeconomic background have more opportunities to continue with their education, even if the annual payment for a school is high. If people in need recive the proper help, they can have multiple job options with high wage, which will favor not only his current family but also its future children.

Moreover, governaments are trying to fight against high rate of poverty in their country. To achieve this, those in needs need to be help by the governament, not only with funds but with new jobs, better housing and incentives. This will benefit the image of the country, next to helping lower classes. Some countries, such as South Korea, are facing a rapid growth which leads to an increase in the gap between poor people and rich families.

","There are several places where adding specific examples or statistics can strengthen the argument made in the essay. Here are a few examples:

1. In the second paragraph, the author discusses the high cost of universities and how this makes it difficult for people from lower socio-economic classes to pursue higher education. Adding specific statistics on average tuition costs for universities in the country being discussed would help to provide more concrete evidence for this argument.

2. In the third paragraph, the author discusses how people in need should also receive new jobs, better housing, and incentives from the government. Adding specific examples of successful government programs that have helped people, such as a housing project or job training initiative, can add credibility to this argument.

3. In the fourth paragraph, the author mentions South Korea as an example of a country experiencing rapid growth and an increasing gap between the rich and poor. Providing specific statistics on poverty rates or income disparities in South Korea would help to illustrate this point more clearly.

Firstly, your introduction is informative, but it could use more detail to grab the reader's attention. I suggest adding a sentence or two about the implications of the government's role in helping citizens. 

Next, in your second paragraph, you mention the high cost of education for people from lower socio-economic classes. I recommend expanding on this topic by incorporating statistical evidence and examples to support your point. Additionally, you could rephrase your sentence structure to make your points more concise and clear.

In your third paragraph, discussing how the government can aid low-income families, it would be beneficial to split the paragraph into two or three shorter paragraphs for easier reading. Moreover, you could develop your point more by offering some specific examples of how other governments have fought poverty. Lastly, you mention the income gap in South Korea, but you don't dive into it as much as you could. You could incorporate more information to describe how this income gap affects people's lives.

Finally, your conclusion is well-written, but it could be stronger. You could summarize your argument more assertively and effectively.

Overall, your essay is written well, and with a few improvements, it can become even better. Keep up the good work!",5,R Evaluation,"Government help is a highly debated topic nowadays. Both citizens and political parties have varying opinions, making it hard for a democratic consensus to be reached. I believe government should help individuals following their income, giving priority to those in the most need. This approach will help them to explore new opportunities and lower the poverty rate of the country.

Many people from lower socio-economic classes tend to have less education due to the high cost of universities. These days, tuition fees and the cost of textbooks and class supplies can easily average at $500 per semester, which represents a significant portion of income for people with financial difficulties. Therefore, the government should provide scholarships and financial aid to help them achieve a better education. People from wealthier backgrounds have more opportunities to pursue higher education, even if it comes at a high annual cost. If individuals in need receive the proper assistance, they can have access to job opportunities with higher wages, which would benefit not only their current families but also future generations.

Moreover, governments are trying to fight against the high rate of poverty in their country. To achieve this, those in need need to be helped by the government, not only with funds but also with new jobs, better housing, and incentives. This will benefit the image of the country along with helping the lower classes. Some countries, such as South Korea, are facing rapid growth, which leads to an increase in the gap between poor people and rich families: the income gap between the wealthiest 10% and least wealthy 10% in South Korea is substantial, with a difference of 21 times(Hankyoreh, 2021).In cities like Seoul, extremely fancy districts are seen and right around the corner, old houses which look almost like they are falling apart are present. Most of them are filled with the old generation, which was left behind during the economic expansion. The situation may not be attractive to tourists, who might feel uncomfortable with sleeping in such areas. The government has to preserve the image of the country while helping those in need.

In conclusion, by investing in those most in need, governments not only improve the lives of individuals and communities, but also pave the way for a brighter and more prosperous future. Therefore, a government that assists the underprivileged can aid in fostering a fair and inclusive society, driving towards a more prosperous future.

This end-to-end approach was preferred over the separation of the problem into multiple subtasks, namely action placement and action selection, which is commonly used in the beatmap generation domain.

The subsequent placement test confirmed the results for 37 people, while three were moved from the beginner to the intermediate category.
Participants then responded to a questionnaire to assess if the generated beatmaps had the same quality as the human-made ones. The questionnaire asked participants to rate the difficulty level, enjoyment, and overall quality of each beatmap on a scale from 1 to 5.

Conclusion

<essay>This work proposed an alternative method for random gradient pruning called Skip-Reduce. We achieved notable performance benefits without loss in accuracy, most notably 11.25% speed-up in ResNet50 training and 25.75% speed-up in VGG16 training. 

Skip-Reduce performs random pruning by skipping devices, thereby saving time on All-Reduce operations. Unlike previous work, Skip-Reduce does not suffer from scalability issues on Ring AllReduce and does not require expensive gradient sorting operations. It allows costless random pruning at any percentage, overcoming the need to send the indices along with the retained gradients. 

With more devices in the ring, Skip-Reduce enables fine-grained choices of skipping steps and pruning percentages. Moreover, using Adaptive Skip-Reduce allows the design of more sophisticated pruning strategies, providing a trade-off between accuracy and performance.

Due to the lack of available computing resources, the evaluations in this work were done on relatively small systems (4-GPU and 8-GPU), however the performance benefit is expected to be greater in large-scale systems, consisting of hundreds of devices. Despite these limitations, this work has presented notable improvement on a 8-GPU system and has shown theoretical analysis of large-scale systems. Generalizing Skip-Reduce to other algorithms and hierarchical systems will be a focus for future research.

The experimental apparatus used in this study consisted of a personal computer(PC) equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti graphics card, HTC Vive Pro Eye head-mounted display(HMD), two Vive Trackers (one for the participant’s left foot and one for the right foot), the Unity game engine, and the Ready Player Me software. The Unity game engine was used to create the virtual environment and the interactive scenarios. The Ready Player me software was  used to generate virtual avatars.
The experiment was conducted in a soundproof room. The room was equipped with a personal computer(PC) that was used to collect questionnaire answers. During the experiment, participants stood in front of two Vive base stations in the room, and were instructed to wear the VR headset and trackers, which allowed for head and body movement tracking in the virtual environment.  

Avatar set
For the experiment, a total of 144 avatars were generated, with 72 avatars for male participants and another 72 avatars for female participants. The generated avatars’ sex was matched to the participants’ sex to ensure that participants were presented with avatars that matched their own gender. The avatars were further divided into six different experimental conditions, with each condition consisting of 12 avatars. Specifically, for each condition, 4 avatars had red hair, 4 avatars had black hair, and 4 avatars  had gold hair, with different hairstyles for each avatar. In addition, 6 avatars within each condition had a comparatively darker skin color, while the remaining 6 had a comparatively lighter skin color. 12 avatars in the same condition wore the same clothing, and there were no duplicated avatars among the 144 total. (See appendix for the visual information.) 

Participants
Participants were recruited within the KAIST community. 34 undergraduate and graduate students participated in the experiment (17 females, 17 males, mean age: 00, age SD = 0.00, age range: 00-00 years, 3 foreigners, 31 Koreans), all with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All participants received 20,000won for their participation (duration: 60-90 min) 

Procedure
Preparation
Once participants arrived, consent agreement documents were provided to obtain their signature. Subsequently, instructions regarding the experiment were given to the participants, and after ensuring their comprehension of the experiment procedure, they were escorted to the experiment room to don the HMD and trackers.

Eye calibration
When the participant was ready to begin the experiment, an eye calibration process was performed. 

Avatar selection
Following the eye calibration, a total of 12 avatars were presented to the participants in a grid format with 4 columns and 3 rows. Participants were then instructed to select an avatar as “My avatar”, while the researcher simultaneously selected an avatar as “Friend avatar”. Depending on the condition, participants either chose their own “My avatar” or it was chosen by the researcher. The hair color of the “Friend avatar” matched that of the participant’s “My avatar”, while their skin color differed from the “My avatar”.

Avatar exposure
After the avatar selection stage, “My avatar” and “Friend avatar” were sequentially presented in front of the participant for 3 seconds each. During this presentation, the avatar was rotated in a horizontal direction by 360 degrees, thereby enabling the participant to perceive the avatar’s distinguishing features from the back, side, and front of the avatar evenly. 

Avatar embodiment
Following the avatar exposure, participants proceeded with the avatar embodiment process in which they were presented with a virtual mirror displaying “My avatar” and “Friend avatar”. Participants were then instructed to answer a series of questions regarding the mirror’s display of the avatars’ bodies and perform several movements, including clapping, touching their left shoulder with their right hand, and touching their friend avatar’s shoulder with their right hand. They were then asked to mimic the friend avatar’s pose and take a photo of themselves using the left-hand controller. The friend avatar posed in four different ways sequentially, with each pose involving lifting either the right arm, left arm, right foot, or left foot. Participants were asked to replicate each pose twice. The motion synchronization of “My avatar” with the participant was dependent on the condition, and could either be controlled by a button or remain still. The entire embodiment process was completed in an average of 3 minutes.
   
Visual search task
Next, the participant completed a visual search task involving the identification of either “My avatar” or “Friend avatar” within a grid of 12 avatars presented in a 4x3 format. At the start of each trial, a pop-up window displaying the target avatar was presented, which participants were required to click to initiate the search task.

I have a few suggestions that could help you improve it even more. 

Firstly, it would be helpful to provide some context about the study before diving into the methodology. This could include a brief overview of the research question or hypothesis, and why it's important to investigate. 

Secondly, it would be useful to provide some description of the design of the study, such as whether it's a between-subjects or within-subjects design. 

Lastly, there are a few areas where you could be more specific. For example, you mentioned that the entire embodiment process was completed in an average of 3 minutes, but it would be helpful to specify the range of times participants took to complete the task. Additionally, you could specify how many trials were included in the visual search task, rather than just stating the total number completed across all conditions. 

Overall, your methodology section provides a clear and concise overview of the apparatus, experimental conditions, participants, and procedures used in your study. Well done!",3,ACK,"Apparatus 
The experimental apparatus used in this study consisted of a personal computer(PC) equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti graphics card, HTC Vive Pro Eye head-mounted display(HMD), two Vive Trackers (one for the participant’s left foot and one for the right foot), the Unity game engine, and the Ready Player Me software. The Unity game engine was used to create the virtual environment and the interactive scenarios. The Ready Player me software was  used to generate virtual avatars.
The experiment was conducted in a soundproof room. The room was equipped with a personal computer(PC) that was used to collect questionnaire answers. During the experiment, participants stood in front of two Vive base stations in the room, and were instructed to wear the VR headset and trackers, which allowed for head and body movement tracking in the virtual environment.  

Avatar set
For the experiment, a total of 144 avatars were generated, with 72 avatars for male participants and another 72 avatars for female participants. The generated avatars’ sex was matched to the participants’ sex to ensure that participants were presented with avatars that matched their own gender. The avatars were further divided into six different experimental conditions, with each condition consisting of 12 avatars. Specifically, for each condition, 4 avatars had red hair, 4 avatars had black hair, and 4 avatars  had gold hair, with different hairstyles for each avatar. In addition, 6 avatars within each condition had a comparatively darker skin color, while the remaining 6 had a comparatively lighter skin color. 12 avatars in the same condition wore the same clothing, and there were no duplicated avatars among the 144 total. (See appendix for the visual information.) 

Participants
Participants were recruited within the KAIST community. 34 undergraduate and graduate students participated in the experiment (17 females, 17 males, mean age: 00, age SD = 0.00, age range: 00-00 years, 3 foreigners, 31 Koreans), all with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All participants received 20,000won for their participation (duration: 60-90 min) 

Procedure
Preparation
Once participants arrived, consent agreement documents were provided to obtain their signature. Subsequently, instructions regarding the experiment were given to the participants, and after ensuring their comprehension of the experiment procedure, they were escorted to the experiment room to don the HMD and trackers.

Eye calibration
When the participant was ready to begin the experiment, an eye calibration process was performed. 

Avatar selection
Following the eye calibration, a total of 12 avatars were presented to the participants in a grid format with 4 columns and 3 rows. Participants were then instructed to select an avatar as “My avatar”, while the researcher simultaneously selected an avatar as “Friend avatar”. Depending on the condition, participants either chose their own “My avatar” or it was chosen by the researcher. The hair color of the “Friend avatar” matched that of the participant’s “My avatar”, while their skin color differed from the “My avatar”.

Avatar exposure
After the avatar selection stage, “My avatar” and “Friend avatar” were sequentially presented in front of the participant for 3 seconds each. During this presentation, the avatar was rotated in a horizontal direction by 360 degrees, thereby enabling the participant to perceive the avatar’s distinguishing features from the back, side, and front of the avatar evenly. 

Avatar embodiment
Following the avatar exposure, participants proceeded with the avatar embodiment process in which they were presented with a virtual mirror displaying “My avatar” and “Friend avatar”. Participants were then instructed to answer a series of questions regarding the mirror’s display of the avatars’ bodies and perform several movements, including clapping, touching their left shoulder with their right hand, and touching their friend avatar’s shoulder with their right hand. They were then asked to mimic the friend avatar’s pose and take a photo of themselves using the left-hand controller. The friend avatar posed in four different ways sequentially, with each pose involving lifting either the right arm, left arm, right foot, or left foot. Participants were asked to replicate each pose twice. The motion synchronization of “My avatar” with the participant was dependent on the condition, and could either be controlled by a button or remain still. The entire embodiment process was completed in an average of 3 minutes.
   
Visual search task
Next, the participant completed a visual search task involving the identification of either “My avatar” or “Friend avatar” within a grid of 12 avatars presented in a 4x3 format. At the start of each trial, a pop-up window displaying the target avatar was presented, which participants were required to click to initiate the search task. Once the target image was clicked, the pop-up window closed, and the 12 avatars were presented. Participants were instructed to locate the target avatar as quickly as possible and click on it using their right hand controller.

Visual search task is a widely used experimental paradigm to study visual attention and perception in cognitive psychology[1,2,3]. During the visual search task, visual stimuli are presented with a display to participants and participants are asked to search for a specific target stimulus among distractors. In my experiment, the visual search task was manipulated using a within subject design to study whether the pop-out phenomenon applies for the self-avatar representation in virtual reality.

Can you provide me with a bit more detail about what you learned specifically about verb forms, such as when and how to use gerunds and infinitives?",4,Answer,"Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have gained popularity as a sustainable transportation option due to their ability to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional vehicles. HEVs utilize multiple power sources, typically an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, to provide propulsion. However, to achieve optimal performance and efficiency, HEVs require advanced control strategies, including optimal velocity planning and energy management.
Optimal velocity planning involves determining the most efficient speed trajectory for a vehicle based on various factors such as road conditions, traffic, and vehicle characteristics. The goal of optimal velocity planning is to minimize energy consumption while maintaining a desired travel time or distance. By optimizing the vehicle's speed profile, optimal velocity planning can reduce energy waste caused by inefficient acceleration or braking.
Energy management is another critical component of HEV control. In an HEV, the energy flow between the power sources, such as the battery and the internal combustion engine, must be optimized to minimize energy loss and improve overall efficiency. Energy management strategies involve controlling the power sources to provide the required propulsion while minimizing energy waste and maximizing energy recovery during regenerative braking.
The combination of optimal velocity planning and energy management can lead to significant improvements in HEV performance and efficiency. Multi-objective optimization techniques can be used to simultaneously optimize both velocity planning and energy management, considering multiple performance metrics, such as energy consumption, travel time, and emissions. Multi-objective optimization can help find trade-offs between conflicting objectives and provide a set of optimal solutions that balance different goals.
In conclusion, optimal velocity planning and energy management are essential components of HEV control, and their optimization through multi-objective optimization techniques can lead to significant improvements in HEV performance and efficiency.","Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have gained popularity as a sustainable transportation option due

Gait stability was evaluated using the 6-minute walking test [1]. The results were analyzed based on experiments involving four male participants.

The 'No Robot' state refers to walking without the robot, while 'Robot Off' and 'Robot On' states refer to walking with the robot. The only difference between the 'Robot Off' and 'Robot On' states is that the 'Off' state indicates the robot without activation, while the 'On' state indicates the robot with activation.

However, it was found that the standard deviation of torso movements showed meaningful differences. The standard deviation of torso movements in Robot On state was 1.0 degree, while the standard deviation in No Robot state was 2.0 degree. This distinction between No Robot and Robot On is understood as the improvement of stride regularity of participants.

Conversely, the cosine similarity loss places emphasis on the angle between vectors rather than their magnitudes. This distinction proves advantageous for maximizing differentiation between classes, thereby enhancing inter-class separability. It promotes the notion that each class should have a unique direction in the embedding space. Moreover, the cosine similarity loss function encourages intra-class compactness.

To vary the structure, consider rephrasing one of the sentences or combining them for a smoother flow. Here is a possible revision:

First one is that people already get their major before they enroll the college, the other is that people choose their major after they are in college for 1 year.

Let's start by identifying any capitalization errors. Remember to capitalize the first letter of the first word in each sentence, proper nouns (names of people, places, or things), titles, and the first word after a colon.

On to the essay, I see some capitalization errors in the following sentences:

- <sent>""Both sides may have their own reasons to support their view.""</sent>
- <sent>""First reason is school uniforms are uncomfortable to wear.""</sent>
- <sent>""Also we need to wear neet and necktie on the shirt.""</sent>

- <sent>""Third reason is students can't wear clothes freely as wheather changes.""</sent>
- <sent>""In Conclusion, I think school uniforms should not be reguired in high students.""</sent>

Next, let's review your grammar. Here are some suggestions to revise your essay:

- In the first sentence, you can rephrase it as <sent>""Some people believe that high school students should be required to wear school uniforms while others disagree.""</sent>
- When you provide your reasons in the following paragraphs, you can start with ""The first reason"" instead of ""First reason.""
- In the sentence <sent>""Also, we need to wear neat and necktie on the shirt,""</sent> you can add ""a"" before ""neat"" to make it ""a neat"" and use the word ""a"" before ""necktie"" as well so that it becomes ""a necktie.""
- In the sentence <sent>""So high school students want to wear clothes that represent themselves,""</sent> you can omit the word ""so"" or start with ""Therefore.""
- In the sentence <sent>""In conclusion, I think school uniforms should not be required for high school students,""</sent> capitalization errors occur in two words - ""conclusion"" and ""required."" You can make them both capitalized as <sent>""In Conclusion, I think school uniforms should not be Reguired for high school students.""</sent>

Both sides may have their own reasons to support their view. If I had to choose one, I would say that school uniforms should not be required for high school students. There are several reasons as follow. First reason is school uniforms are uncomfortable to wear. We need to wear skinny pants and shirt. Also we need to wear neet and necktie on the shirt. so It is very hard to wear and move to other places. And number of sizes are not enough to wear for high school students. For example, some fat students in high school feel very uncomfortable that there are not size that they wear comfortable. Second reason is students can't wear clothes they want. Clothes can represent ourselves to other people. So High school students want to wear clothes that represent themselves. For example some students wear clothes that characters on it to represent they like this chracter. And students can wear clothes as situations in school. For instance, some students like to play soccer in break time. Then they can wear comfortable clothes to play soccer easier. Third reason is students can't wear clothes freely as wheather changes. There are somedays that students feel Cold when wear school uniforms. If school uniforms should be required for high school students, they can't change their clothes warmer. Then students can get diesease or cold. Also students feel temperature differently in same weather. In this case school uniforms can't fit personly at most of days. So we have to make Student can choose their own clothes to adapt in weather. In Conclusion, I think school uniforms should not be reguired in high students.

3. Check to see if you have used commas to separate the items in the list.
4. If you have, make sure that the commas are placed correctly. They should be placed after each item except for the last one, which should be followed by 'and' or 'or'.

Of course freedom of students is important, but I think that high school should control student's clothes and they should wear constant clothes as school uniform.

Firstly, wearing school uniform is very economical. It is needless to say that young people are usually interested in fashion or trend. So they buy new clothes or accessories that are famous for their friends. For example, in 2000s, there were some students so-called ""backbone broker"" in South Korean that required a kind of expensive jackets such as ""Goose down"" for their parents. If high school control students to wear school uniform, students do not have to buy expensive and high-quality clothes to wear in school. Moreover, It is worth pointing that as they wear school uniform for 5 days a week, they don't need large amount of clothes on daily life. As I pointed out, wearing school uniform can reduce payment on clothes, so it is economical.
Secondly, I would like to say that school uniform is able to represent school's identity. Obviously, once school uniform select for specific school, usually it would not change for very long term.

1. In the first sentence you may consider adjusting the verb to match the subject. ""Majority of people"" is singular, so the correct verb form would be ""has experienced,"" rather than ""have.""
2. You may consider using parallel structure in the second sentence. Instead of saying ""This traditional thought that students should wear school uniform,"" you could say ""The traditional notion that students should wear school uniforms has persisted for a long time, even today.""
3. In the second paragraph, you may want to adjust the subject-verb agreement in the second sentence. Instead of using ""I asserts,"" use ""I assert"" since ""I"" is singular. Also, ""with this statement"" at the end of the sentence seems redundant - consider omitting it.
4. In the third paragraph, you may consider adjusting ""schools uniform"" to ""school uniforms"" for subject-verb agreement, and adding an article like ""the"" before ""specific school.""
5. Lastly, you may want to adjust the conclusion sentence to use ""is"" instead of ""should be"" to maintain consistent tense with the rest of the essay.

127,20220097-IRW-3-1-01,IRW,20220097,3,1,1,I learned about transitions. How do I use proper transitions in my essay better than now?,"Great! Good use of transitions can significantly improve the flow and coherence of your essay. Let's get started with the revision process. 

1. First, go through your essay and identify the areas where you have not used any transitions at all or where there are weak or inappropriate transitions. 

2. Then, consider the relationship between the different ideas and points you have presented in your essay. Identify how the ideas connect and try to use transition words or phrases that best fit the relationship between the ideas.

3. You can use several types of transitions such as addition, comparison, contrast, cause and effect, or chronological transitions. 

4. For example, use the addition transitional phrases ""furthermore"" or ""in addition"" to highlight an additional point or ""in conclusion"" to connect your final thoughts.

5. Comparison transitions such as ""similarly"" or ""likewise"" can indicate that two ideas are similar or comparable.

6. Contrast transitions such as ""however"" or ""still"" can reveal a difference or contrast between two ideas.

7. Cause and effect transitions such as ""therefore"" or ""thus"" can indicate the resulting effect of a particular cause.

8. Chronological transitions such as ""firstly,"" ""secondly,"" and ""finally"" can indicate the order in which the ideas are presented.

Remember to use transitions appropriately and sparingly. Overusing transitions can make your essay sound monotonous and tedious. 

Once you have identified the areas where you need to revise, start by replacing weak or inappropriate transitions with appropriate and strong transitions, and remove any unnecessary transitions.

","Great start on your essay! However, there are a few things that can be improved to make your essay clearer and more concise. Here are some suggestions for revision:

1. Grammar and Spelling:
- In the first sentence, ""borned"" should be ""born."" 
- In the fourth sentence, ""high shcool"" should be ""high school,"" and ""tublet"" should be ""tablet."" 
- In the fifth sentence, ""thesedays"" should be ""these days."" 
- In the seventh sentence, ""w/o"" should be ""without."" 
- Throughout the essay, there are also some other simple mistakes such as missing commas in lists and misspelled words. Please take some time to proofread your essay and correct these errors.

2. Clarity and Flow:
- The first two sentences are unclear and could be rephrased. It's not clear what was borned (born) in high-school and what the purpose of the electronic tool was.
- Sentence structure can be improved to make your essay flow better. For example, the sentence ""for example in society class, teacher (or professor) teach some society situation"" could be rephrased to ""For example, in a sociology class, the teacher/professor may present a current social issue.""
- Some of the paragraphs seem too long and could be broken down into shorter paragraphs to make the essay more readable.

3. Supporting Details:
- While you make some good points about the benefits of using a laptop/tablet in class, it would be helpful to add more specific examples to support your argument.
- For instance, you mention that using the internet can provide access to up-to-date information. Could you provide some specific examples of how this has benefited you in a class or a project?
- Similarly, you suggest that using apps like Goodnote can help organize and summarize lectures. Could you provide a more detailed example of how this has helped you?

1. Break up large paragraphs: Your paragraph is quite lengthy and contains several different ideas. Consider breaking it up into shorter paragraphs to make it easier for your reader to follow your train of thought.

2. Use transitional phrases: Use transitional phrases to connect your ideas better. Begin a new paragraph with signals like ""to begin with,"" ""in addition,"" ""second,"" or ""finally"" which will help the reader to understand how the different ideas relate to each other.

3. Watch your grammar: Several places in your essay have varying verb tense. Be sure to keep the verb tense consistent within each sentence.

Here is a suggested revision of your paragraph, showing how it can be broken up into shorter paragraphs with transitional phrases added to help connect your ideas:

Therefore, the government should focus on helping those who are in the most need.

First of all, resources are limited. Given that the wealthiest people own almost all of the resources, if the government helps all of the citizens, then economic inequality will get worse.

Second, wealthy individuals do not feel that they need the government's help to the same degree as those with less wealth.

Wealthy people may even have a motivation to support community help programs, understanding that societal inequality and unfairness may lead to unsustainable and unstable civilizations. Therefore, the government does not need to help wealthy people, and these individuals may even agree with this idea.

Some people might think that this approach could create another kind of inequality. However, such an inequality can be helpful to our society, as it allows more resources to be allocated towards people with the most need.

I like that you have a clear thesis statement and that you've presented three well-developed body paragraphs to support it. However, there are some areas where we can improve the essay using the concepts of organizational and syntactic parallelism. 

First, let's focus on organizational parallelism. It's important to transition smoothly between paragraphs and present your ideas in a logical and chronological manner. Here's an example of a revised introduction that uses organizational parallelism:

""In modern society, it is crucial to ensure fair opportunities and well-being for all citizens. To achieve this, governments should concentrate on supporting those in need, such as individuals from low-income households and the elderly. By providing education, resources, and aid, governments can contribute to a more equitable society that values the potential of all its members.""

In this revised introduction, we've used parallel structure to emphasize the importance of supporting those in need and to highlight the actions that the government can take to make a positive impact.

Next, let's look at syntactic parallelism. You've explained the concept well in your summary, and I think your essay could benefit from using this technique more consistently. Here's an example of how you can revise a sentence to use parallel structure:

Original: ""For instance, many universities and companies prefer a person who can perform well but the people who are in need can't satisfy others need due to their insufficient learning and chances.""

Revised: ""For instance, many universities and companies prefer individuals who can perform well, but those in need often lack the opportunities and resources to develop their skills.""

By using parallel structure in this sentence, we've simplified the language and made the sentence more concise and easy to follow.

Finally, let's focus on the conclusion. It's important to summarize the main points of the essay and restate the thesis in a memorable way. Here's an example of a revised conclusion that uses parallelism:

""In conclusion, governments play a crucial role in ensuring a fair and equitable society by supporting those in need. By providing education, aid, and resources to individuals from low-income households and the elderly, governments can help pave the way for a more equitable future. By investing in the potential of all members of society, we can create a world where opportunity is accessible to all."" 

By using repetition and parallel structure in the final sentence, we've provided a clear and memorable statement that emphasizes the importance of government aid for all citizens.

First, let's start with the punctuation and quotation marks. Take a look at your essay and identify any areas where you think you may need to add, remove, or modify commas and quotation marks. Remember that commas are used to separate elements within a sentence, and quotation marks are used to show a direct quote or indicate a title or short piece of work. Try to add in any missing punctuation that would make your sentences clearer for your reader.

As for using verb form versus noun form, scan your essay again and look for any places where you may have used a noun to describe an action, instead of using the verb form. For example, instead of saying ""the consumption of food,"" you could say ""eating."" Try to use the verb form as much as possible, as it produces more concise and active descriptions.

As a result, they are not likely to improve abilities to have a better status in society. For instance, university is important for a person's various experience for success. However, many universities prefer a person who can perform well. Moreover, some elite universities require quite huge amount of money to register. But what people in need can't satisfy are these external academic supports, because of their environment. Government should make a policy that tries to enhance public education to reduce the other external acardemic supports' influence. In addition, to reduce the economic burden for poors, proper aid of money should be contained in the policy.
Another point to consider is  people who are getting old. Some might think it is unfair to help elders, but all human beings become old. The government should care about their citizens' future and continue to help elders. More specifically, as people get old, their abilities to work reduce, so they have to retire and are not financially independent anymore. Also, they are vulnerable to diseases and medical conditions that require constant attention and medical intervention. Government should not left them in these poor conditions, because they have been contribute to society and still have a wealth of knowledge, skills, and experience that can be helpful for society. Therefore, government should provide seniors with medical and economical supports that contribute to the well-being of both society and individuals who are aging.
Last thing government should care about is stabilty of the society. If the government doesn't focus on helping people in need, the differnce between people's socioeconomic status will worsen. Consequently, the society might become more unstable. Historically, it is clear that there are more conflicts between people when the inequality of chances and unbalanced wealth are evident. For example,  society may experience high rates of crime and violence, as individuals compete for resources and power. Also, societies may suffer from a breakdown in social connections and trust, leading to societal disintegration and a loss of collective values. Hence, government have to care more about people in need for social benefits and stabilty.
 Nowadays, most governments around the world seems to function well, but there are major problems related to the inequality of social status and wealth. These are problems what democracy systems have to solve. One way to adress these problems is strengthening policies that support the social underprivileged. The government should help people in need more carefully to ensure their chance to learn and become sucessful. Moreover, for the citizen's future, government should aid seniors with economical and medical supports that acknowledge the valuable contributions they have made to society. In conclusion, to achieve the critical role of government maintaining society's peace and balanced state, they should concentrate on supporting minorities who have been historically dismissed and overlooked. </essay>","Great job!

So we shouldn't prevent a student from accessing variable subject and the major-free system can be good way for it. As they select the most fit major, the quality of all major group will be improve.
Lastly, the community from college to student get activate and it works as positive-feedback. In major-free system, student choose the major. So the people in each major advertise passionally and research hard to make students' attention. After the students choose the major, they also work hard for next students and for themself to get much budget from the universities.
Therefore, for the universities' future, the major-free system for the first-year is needed. Some says it is irresponsible for students.

","During our class, we discussed how to write an essay about the mandatory wearing of school uniforms. To revise your essay, we will need to go step by step and analyze each part of it. 

First, when it comes to presenting your arguments, you should make sure you have a clear thesis statement. This statement should clearly state your position on the topic of mandatory school uniforms. So, one potential thesis statement could be something like: ""I strongly believe that the mandatory wearing of school uniforms is essential in creating a positive school environment that supports the learning and growth of all students."" 

Once you have your thesis statement, you should then write out your main points. These points should support your thesis and show why you are taking this position. For example, you could argue that school uniforms promote a sense of unity and equality among students, that they help to create a more focused learning environment, or that they save parents money by eliminating the need for expensive clothing purchases. 

Next, we should look at the evidence you are using to support your arguments. You should make sure that any evidence you use is relevant, reliable, and credible. This means that you should use statistics, personal experiences, or research studies to support your claims. For example, you might back up your claim that school uniforms promote a sense of equality by citing research studies that show a decrease in bullying or the negative effects of clothing-based peer pressure. 

Finally, we should analyze your conclusion. This is where you should tie together all of your main points and restate your thesis statement in a clear and concise manner. Your conclusion should leave the reader with a clear understanding of your position and why it is important. 

So, in summary, to revise your essay, we should examine your thesis statement, main points, evidence, and conclusion to make sure that everything is clear, relevant, and effectively supports your position.",2,R Information,"School Uniforms are common recommended by many high schools in almost every region of Korea for students to wear.

1. 첫 번째 문장 ""school uniform - sign of students and teenagers"" : 이 문장에서는 학교 유니폼이 학생이나 청소년을 특징 짓는 요소라는 것을 알 수 있습니다. 이 문장을 좀 더 구체적인 내용으로 보강하면, ""학교 유니폼은 학생이나 청소년을 특징 짓는 의상으로, 학생들의 연령층에게 매우 일반적입니다."" 라고 수정할 수 있습니다.

2. 두 번째 문장 ""protect"" : 이번 문장에서는 학생들이 학교 유니폼을 입음으로써 보호를 받을 수 있다는 것을 의미하는 것으로 이해됩니다. 그러나 이 문장은 이전 문장과 자연스럽게 연결되지 않기 때문에, 좀 더 명확하게 설명하는 것이 좋을 것 같습니다. 따라서, 새롭게 추가된 문장인 ""학교 유니폼을 입으면, 학생들은 보호를 받을 수 있습니다.""라는 문장으로 수정할 수 있습니다.

3. 세 번째 문장 ""someone wearing uniform in trouble will be helped"" : 이 문장에서는 학교 유니폼을 입은 사람들이 어려운 상황에 처했을 때, 도움을 받을 수 있다는 것을 의미합니다. 그러나 이러한 주장이 정확한지에 대한 근거가 없기 때문에, 따로 추가적인 연구나 통계자료가 필요할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, ""설문조사와 통계를 통해 밝혀졌듯이, 학교 유니폼을 입은 사람들이 어려운 상황에 처했을 때, 도움을 받을 가능성이 높아집니다."" 라는 문장으로 수정하면 더욱 정확하게 주장할 수 있을 것입니다.

2번 문단에 대한 annotation으로 바람직할까?","2번 문단(annotation)에 대한 피드백을 드리겠습니다.

1. 첫 번째 문장 ""school uniform - helpful for students"" : 이 문장에서는 학교 유니폼이 학생들에게 도움이 된다는 것을 의미하는 것으로 이해됩니다. 그러나, 이 주장에 대한 근거와 구체적인 내용을 추가하는 것이 좋을 것입니다. 예를 들어, ""학교 유니폼은 학생들에게 필요한 정돈된 환경을 제공하고, 학생들이 모두 같은 복장을 입음으로써 상호 간의 기초적인 교류를 할 수 있게 도와줍니다."" 라는 문장으로 수정하여, 해당 주장에 대한 구체적인 내용을 더욱 부각시킬 수 있습니다.

2. 두 번째 문장 ""no need paper that probe students"" : 이 문장은 이전 문장과 연결되지 않으며, 이해하기 어렵습니다. 좀 더 명확한 내용을 추가하는 것이 필요합니다. 예를 들어, ""학교 유니폼은 학생들에게 더 이상 시험종이를 구비하지 않아도 된다는 이점을 제공합니다."" 라는 문장으로 수정하면, 주장이 더욱 명확해질 것입니다.

3. 세 번째 문장 ""only uniform > take a advantage is possible"" : 이 문장에서는 유니폼 하나만으로 학생들이 이점을 얻을 수 있다는 것을 시사하고 있으며, 그러나 더 자세하게 설명이 필요한 부분이 있습니다. 예를 들어, ""학교 유니폼을 착용함으로써 학생들은 동기부여를 얻을 수 있고, 가장 좋은 모습으로 선보였을 때 점수를 받을 수 있는 등 학교 생활 전반적으로 이득을 얻을 수 있습니다."" 라는 문장으로 수정하면, 더 구체적이고 명확한 함의를 담을 수 있을 것입니다.

 First of all, School uniforms are an identification that proves the students or teenagers and allows them to get help and advantages.

Moreover, they also can take advantage when they are using public transportation, shopping, and watching a movie at the theater.

 Secondly, school uniforms help to reduce economic polarization. If school uniforms rules are removed, teenagers will tend to spend more money and time to find unique clothes and  trendy outers. There are some statistics that show teenagers are very sensitive to fashion and always want to wear fancy clothes except only school uniforms. School uniforms make students feel uniformity since there are no differences.

 Lastly, School Uniforms allow the students to navigate the right path. While wearing a uniform, students feel more duty and responsibility, so they tend to take the right path.

 First of all, School uniforms are an identification that proves the students or teenagers and allows them to get help and advantages. By wearing a uniform, students can easily get help and ask questions to adults during emergency situations. Moreover, they also can take advantage when they are using public transportation, shopping, and watching a movie at the theater. We can easily find the various educational and cultural organizations that give discounts or free tickets for students. Students don’t need a supplementary document and qualification if they wear school uniforms.

 Secondly, school uniforms help to reduce economic polarization. If school uniforms rules are removed, teenagers will tend to spend more money and time to find unique clothes and  trendy outers. There are some statistics that show teenagers are very sensitive to fashion and always want to wear fancy clothes except only school uniforms. School uniforms make students feel uniformity since there are no differences.

 Lastly, School Uniforms allow the students to navigate the right path. While wearing a uniform, students feel more duty and responsibility, so they tend to take the right path.

First, students don’t need to bring their heavy textbooks in class.

It is much more convenient than bringing their heavy textbooks, notes, and extra papers.

 Second, with a tablet/laptop computer, students can search for information easily and quickly. With the vast amount of information available on the Internet, they can easily find the definition of some terms, or the meaning of abstract concepts. Using these devices enable students to deeply understand what their professor says.

 Lastly, using a tablet/laptop computer can help students supplement what they missed in class through the recorded lecture. Although students write their notes to understand and to remember the lecture, there is a limit with just writing some sentences. If students can record a video or an audio for lecture, students can supplement what they missed in class; therefore students can learn more about the topic they are dealing with.

 As technology continues to evolve and shape our future lives, the use of tablet/laptop computers in the classroom is becoming increasingly important. By accepting these advancements, we can provide students with a more effective and engaging learning experience that help them prepare for the future.",TRUE,TRUE,UNSUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL

 For these reasons, I think government should help all of citizens. Yet, it is needed t classify poors who need to be helped strongly.</essay>","Thank you for sharing your essay. 

First, let's go ahead and apply the comma rule for separating items in a list. In the second sentence of your essay, you could add a comma after the word ""controversial,"" as that signals to the reader that the sentence will contain two separate thoughts. Here is the revised sentence: 

<sent>""It is quite controversial how much of people should be designated as socioeconomical poor, however, as I read many articles, I found many people agree to help someone most need to be more careful from the government.""</sent>

Next, let's review the usage of ""yet."" In the last sentence, you have used ""yet"" correctly as you are showing a contrast - you believe government should help all citizens, yet they need to prioritize their assistance to those who are considered the poorest. 

Now, let's work on some sentence-level issues. In the third sentence, the phrase ""although they are overly weak"" is a bit unclear. Who or what is ""they""? I think you might be referring to socioeconomically poor people, but the phrase isn't connected to a noun or pronoun that was referred to previously in the essay. Instead, consider adding a new sentence to clarify your thoughts. For example: 

<sent>""Although socioeconomically poor people are considered the most vulnerable citizens in our society, I believe the government should help all of its citizens to ensure everyone has access to basic necessities and resources.""</sent>

In the last paragraph, be sure to revise the sentence ""For these reasons, I think government should help all of citizens"" to say <sent>""For these reasons, I think the government should help all of its citizens."" Since you are referring to a specific government (i.e. the one of the country you are writing about), it is important to include the possessive pronoun ""its.""</sent>

Finally, I recommend reading through your essay again to catch any other typos, errors, or sentence fragments. Overall, your essay has a strong argument, but could benefit from some revisions to improve its clarity and flow.

The first benefit is that digital devices allow students to use the necessary digital abilities required for their classes. Many professors provide “lecture notes” to students, which they need to access during class time. Taking notes on laptops and tablets improves students’ learning and memorization abilities. Additionally, subjects such as programming, design, and composition often require the use of digital devices during class. Therefore, using tablets and laptops increases students' productivity and engagement during class.

Secondly, digital devices can help reduce the burden on students during campus life. Devices like tablets can replace bulky textbooks, various types of notes, pens/pencils, and memo sheets. All necessary equipment for studying is contained in a single portable device. Furthermore, students can perform various functions on a tablet, such as recording lectures and submitting assignments online, making studying more convenient and efficient.

The third benefit is that professors and TAs can execute more efficient work styles by incorporating electronic devices into their classes. By using such devices, teachers can receive assignments online, automatically check grades and attendance, and present lectures more effectively.

One of the results is that everyone in class tends to use some form of technology. However, some argue that using tablets and laptops can be distracting. Despite the potential side effects, the use of tablets/laptops has many advantages, which are highlighted below.

The first benefit is that digital devices allow students to use the necessary digital abilities required for their classes. Many professors provide “lecture notes” to students, which they need to access during class time. Taking notes on laptops and tablets improves students’ learning and memorization abilities. Additionally, subjects such as programming, design, and composition often require the use of digital devices during class. Therefore, using tablets and laptops increases students' productivity and engagement during class.

Secondly, digital devices can help reduce the burden on students during campus life. Devices like tablets can replace bulky textbooks, various types of notes, pens/pencils, and memo sheets. All necessary equipment for studying is contained in a single portable device. Furthermore, students can perform various functions on a tablet, such as recording lectures and submitting assignments online, making studying more convenient and efficient.

The third benefit is that professors and TAs can execute more efficient work styles by incorporating electronic devices into their classes. By using such devices, teachers can receive assignments online, automatically check grades and attendance, and present lectures more effectively. Many professors are already adopting digital systems in their classes. Thus, using tablets and laptops in class can make not just students but also professors and TAs comfortable and efficient.

Although there are numerous advantages, some users may use tablets and laptops inappropriately. However, such issues can be tackled by encouraging healthy habits and self-discipline among students, rather than implementing policies that prohibit the use of digital devices. Therefore, tablets and laptops should be allowed in class, given the advantages mentioned above.","As technology continues to develop, various types of individual devices have been invented.

192,20220324-AW-1-1-01,AW,20220324,1,1,1,"Today I learned about the comma rules. When there is a list that contains two or more elements, we should use commas to separate them","Great job! Here is how we can start revising your essay based on what you learned today.

First, I recommend reading through your essay and identifying any lists with two or more elements.
Once you have identified these lists, make sure to add a comma after each element, separating them clearly.

For example:

Before revision: My favorite fruits are apples bananas and oranges.

After revision: My favorite fruits are apples, bananas, and oranges.

Next, it is important to double-check that you are using commas correctly in any complex sentences. Here are some common comma rules we discussed in class to help guide you:

1. Use a comma to separate independent clauses when they are joined by a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet) - for example: I like to read books, but I prefer to watch movies.

2. Use a comma after introductory words or phrases - for example: Before we begin our lesson, let's review last week's material.

3. Use commas to set off non-essential clauses or phrases - for example: My friend Emily, who is traveling to Europe next week, loves to try new foods.

Remember, good writing takes practice, so don't be afraid to revise your essay multiple times until it is clear, concise, and error-free.",3,Answer,," Some people in Korean have a question about military service. Why only men should go to military? Why only man spand their precious time in military? They even say this military system of men's are one of the gender discriminatory. So, they say also women go to military like men's do. Is it right thinking? Is tihs true that military system is discriminatory about gender? I don't think so. Of course, it is hard to go military, but it can't be reason that military service should be extended to encompass female Korean. Let me give you some reasons that encourage my opinion.
 First, the problem of man's military service is not gender discrimination. It is just the problem of differences from men and women. In fact, men usually are stronger and have greater health. It is physical difference from men and women. The military, as you known as have a lot of time that exercise, training, etc. Some military's hard training is difficult to women to sucess that. Because of women's physical, the military service is hard to be extended to women. Of course, there are some strong women that can work more that men. But this is not good in terms of efficiency.
 Also, there are some problems if we extended the military service to Korean women. For example, we must build new dormitary for women. Moreover, we have to prepare some place that need to wemen, like women's toilets, women's shower system, and also women's hospitals. Those preparing steps need a lot of moneys. This is not good for us.
 Lastly, because of women military service, the tax on military will increase. These days, already we have to pay lots of tax in military. If we extend military service on women, this military tax will be increased much more, and it makes us hard to live. The tax problem is not simple problem. We have to rebuild some dormitary and pay money to military women. These all the tax. Do you have enough money to pay it?
 To sum up, extending military service to women is not good for us because lots of money like tax and false asspect that military serviece of men is discrimination of gender.

193,20220324-AW-1-1-02,AW,20220324,1,1,2,syntatic parallelism,"Great question! Syntactic parallelism is a writing technique that involves using grammatically parallel structures in a sentence or paragraph. Essentially, it means using the same grammatical structure to connect related ideas or items. This helps to make the writing clearer, more organized, and more memorable to the reader.

Here's an example of syntactic parallelism:

Non-parallel: <sent>The child was laughing, jumping up and was singing his favorite song.</sent>

Parallel: <sent>The child was laughing, jumping up, and singing his favorite song.</sent>

In the non-parallel sentence, the verb forms used for laughing, jumping, and singing are different, creating an uneven structure. In the parallel sentence, each verb is expressed in the same gerund form, creating a more balanced and pleasing structure.

To use syntactic parallelism in your writing, you can start by identifying related ideas or items that you want to connect in a sentence or paragraph. Then, try to use the same grammatical structure for each item. This might include using the same verb tense, the same prepositional phrase, or the same noun.

Remember, using syntactic parallelism can help to improve the clarity and effectiveness of your writing, but it should be used sparingly and appropriately. Overuse of parallel structures can make your writing sound repetitive or boring.",4,R Language Use," Some people in Korean have a question about military service. Why only men should go to military?

In such critical situations, governments should prioritize the aid to those who require it the most, including the elderly, children, and low-income households.

Another example where governments should preferentially help those in need is in the area of healthcare. The government should work to provide universal access to quality healthcare services, regardless of individual financial resources. This is crucial because low-income households are disadvantaged when it comes to accessing quality healthcare and require special attention.

Finally, governments should focus on providing educational opportunities to marginalized communities. Education is a crucial aspect of empowering individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds and providing them with the tools needed to achieve long-term financial stability. In conclusion, supporting those in need is an essential responsibility of governments and ensures equitable opportunities for all citizens.

This includes providing healthcare, education, social services, and maintaining critical infrastructure such as transportation and utility systems. Governments also have the responsibility to maintain a fair and just legal system, protect the environment and natural resources, and engage in diplomacy with other countries to promote peace and security.","Governments are responsible for providing assistance to their citizens, but with finite resources and a limited workforce, it is important that this assistance be targeted towards those in need.

2. Education and training programs - Governments also offer education and training programs to help individuals gain the skills and knowledge needed to secure better-paying jobs and improve their economic prospects. These programs might include vocational training, adult education classes, and job placement services.

3. Healthcare - Access to healthcare is essential for everyone, but low-income families and individuals may face significant barriers to receiving quality care. Some governments provide healthcare options at little to no cost for those who cannot afford traditional healthcare plans.

4. Housing assistance - Governments can offer housing assistance to those who cannot afford safe and adequate housing. This assistance might take the form of rental vouchers, affordable housing developments, or subsidized mortgage programs.

1. Welfare programs - Governments often provide welfare programs such as food stamps, unemployment benefits, and housing assistance to low-income families and individuals who need financial assistance. These programs are designed to help those in need, and eligibility is often determined by income level and other factors that indicate economic hardship.

2. Education and training programs - Governments also offer education and training programs to help individuals gain the skills and knowledge needed to secure better-paying jobs and improve their economic prospects. These programs might include vocational training, adult education classes, and job placement services.

3. Healthcare - Access to healthcare is essential for everyone, but low-income families and individuals may face significant barriers to receiving quality care. Some governments provide healthcare options at little to no cost for those who cannot afford traditional healthcare plans.

4. Housing assistance - Governments can offer housing assistance to those who cannot afford safe and adequate housing. This assistance might take the form of rental vouchers, affordable housing developments, or subsidized mortgage programs.

In all these programs, the primary focus is on helping those who are in need of assistance. By prioritizing those who require the most help, governments can ensure that resources are directed towards those who need them most and make the most impact on their well-being.

1. Use a comma to separate items in a list of three or more.

Example: I need to buy apples, bananas, and oranges.

2. Use a comma to separate two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, nor, for, yet, so).

Example: I want to go to the beach, but it's raining.

3. Use a comma after an introductory phrase or clause.

Example: After finishing my homework, I went to bed.

4. Use a comma to set off nonessential information (words, phrases, or clauses) in a sentence.

7. ""Although students have already chosen their major to study, ohter major can attract them so they can want to study other things"" - This should be revised to ""Although students have already chosen their major, they may still be interested in other fields and want to explore other subjects.""

215,20220488-AW-4-1-01,AW,20220488,4,1,1,"<essay> Should the government help those most in need , or should it help all of its citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background?. 
 There have been a lot of controversies on the social security system and governmental welfare. Some says the government should help and support all of its citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background insisting the fairness. But I think the government should help those most in need to achieve the goal of real fairness for several reasons. 
 First of all , helping those in need is the way to accomplish the practical fairness. If the government supplies financial supports to all the citizen including rich people , is it a right way to achieve the true meaning of fairness? Such help would be meaningless and even increase the gap between rich and poor people which can cause a severe social problem. To make more citizens happier, the government productive should help people in need.
 In addition to the problem of practical fairness , helping all people is not efficient. It is well known that the happiness increases when the income rises up to certain extent, but after some level , happiness has little to do with the income level . Since the budget of the government for welfare is confined , we should use it efficiently. The amount of support that each individual receives becomes far less if the government helps all the people. However, by giving support to people, it would be more effective to increase the overall happiness of the country and make the country more productive.
 In conclusion, the government should prioritize helping those in need to achieve practical fairness, increase overall happiness, and promote productivity in society.</essay>","Great job summarizing your essay! To begin revising, let's focus on strengthening your introduction. Instead of saying <sent>""There have been a lot of controversies on the social security system and governmental welfare,""</sent> try starting with a more attention-grabbing statement or anecdote related to the topic. This will engage the reader right from the start.

Next, let's take a look at your thesis statement. While you do state your stance on the issue, <sent>""I think the government should help those most in need,""</sent> it is not clear and concise enough. Try rephrasing it to: <sent>""The government should prioritize assisting individuals with the greatest need to ensure practical fairness, increased overall happiness, and a more productive society,""</sent> to make your stance clearer and more compelling.

Moving on to your body paragraphs, it is helpful to use topic sentences that clearly introduce the main idea of each paragraph. For example, in the first paragraph, you could write, <sent>""Providing financial support to all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic background, is not an effective means of achieving true fairness and can exacerbate wealth disparities. Therefore, the government should prioritize assistance for those with the greatest need."" </sent>This makes the topic of the paragraph clear and helps the reader follow your argument.

Additionally, instead of just stating your opinion, try to provide evidence and examples that support your ideas. This will make your argument more convincing. For example, you could cite studies or statistics that show how providing support to those in need boosts overall happiness and productivity. 

Finally, be sure to conclude your essay with a strong overall statement that summarizes your argument and leaves the reader with something to think about. Reiterate your stance and the reasons why you believe it's the best approach.

For example, in the first paragraph, you could say, ""We can easily find a wealth of information on the Internet. Many university courses use complex terminology, but a quick search can help us understand."" Try to break up long sentences into shorter, more concise ones. 

In the second paragraph, there is a typo (""illigal"" instead of ""illegal"") and a run-on sentence.

Traditional textbooks can be heavy, with just a couple weighing up to 5kg. However, a tablet can hold thousands of PDFs without adding significant weight."" 

Lastly, in the third paragraph, there is another run-on sentence. You could revise it to say something like, ""One major advantage of tablets is the availability of note-taking applications. These apps can help students take notes more efficiently than traditional paper methods, and can include helpful features for studying.""

1. Use capital letters for the beginning of every sentence - You started your essay with a lowercase letter. Each new sentence should start with a capital letter. 

2. Capitalize proper nouns - In the second sentence, capitalization is incorrect for ""students"" and ""KAIST,"" as those are proper nouns. 

3. Capitalize the first letter of each word in a title - You did not capitalize ""Zoom function"" in the last paragraph. The first letter of each word in a title should be capitalized, except for articles, prepositions, and coordinating conjunctions. 

4. Capitalize acronyms and initialisms - In the first sentence, ""KAIST"" should be capitalized as it is an acronym for a school name.

One suggestion that I have for you is to include a thesis statement that specifically outlines the main points/principles that you will be exploring in your essay. Here's an example of a revised introduction with a clear thesis statement:

In today's digital age, tablets and laptops have become ubiquitous tools for students, including at KAIST. While concerns have been raised about the potential negative effects of these devices on student concentration and eye health, it is important to recognize the many benefits that they offer for academic success. This essay will explore three key advantages of using tablets and laptops in the classroom: time savings, increased learning efficiency, and improved space efficiency. 

Now let's take a closer look at your body paragraphs to review the unity and coherence of your essay. 

First of all, tablets and laptops permit students to save time. The functions of searching and recording could allow students to save their time. Specifically, searching function in the electronic devices allow us to fine the information, which we are not aware of or which are confused, quickly, Students just type the word that they want to know, and just for a moment, lots of useful information come out. When it comes to recording function, students could record the lecture. After that, they can play it 1.5 or twice time faster. So they can save their time using an efficient way.

This paragraph is well organized and the topic sentence is clear. The paragraph focuses on the time saving advantages of using tablets and laptops in the classroom. You provide two specific examples of how electronic devices can save time – through efficient search functions and recording capabilities, and both of these examples are related to the main point of the paragraph. 

Second, using tablets and laptops, students can study more efficient. Let's get back to the recording functions. students can listen again the lecture. This means they can pick up what they didn't understand at that time during the class, and they can study that part while they understand the information.

This paragraph could benefit from more detail and specific examples to more fully support your idea of increased learning efficiency. Here's an example of how you could expand the paragraph with more detail:

Another key advantage of using tablets and laptops in the classroom is that they can make studying more efficient by allowing students to review lecture content at their own pace. For example, recording functions can help students pick up on information they may have missed during class or that did not make sense to them at the time. By listening to recordings multiple times and studying challenging material more closely, students are better able to grasp course concepts and improve their grades. 

Finally it will be helpful to space-efficiency. By using Zoom function of electronic devices, it is not necessary that all students have to come to class. If there is the class that too many students are existed, this will be more helpful.

This paragraph is a bit unclear and could benefit from a clearer explanation of your point about space efficiency. Here's an example of a revised paragraph with more detail:

Finally, the use of tablets and laptops in the classroom can have a positive effect on space efficiency. With the advent of video conferencing technologies like Zoom, electronic devices can allow students to participate in classes and collaborate with their peers from anywhere. For instance, if a class is oversubscribed and too many students are present physically, electronic devices can be used to provide remote access and allow everyone to participate equally. Additionally, eBooks and online course materials can greatly reduce the physical space requirements for traditional textbooks and other teaching materials, resulting in more effective use of classroom resources.

In conclusion, your essay overall demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts of unity and coherence. By focusing on a clear thesis statement and ensuring that each paragraph has a main idea that supports the overall argument, you are on the right track toward constructing an effective and compelling essay.

For example, recording functions can help students pick up on information they may have missed during class or that did not make sense to them at the time. By listening to recordings multiple times and studying challenging material more closely, students are better able to grasp course concepts and improve their grades.
 Finally, the use of tablets and laptops in the classroom can have a positive effect on space efficiency. With the advent of video conferencing technologies like Zoom, electronic devices can allow students to participate in classes and collaborate with their peers from anywhere. For example, if a class is oversubscribed and too many students are present physically, electronic devices can be used to provide remote access and allow everyone to participate equally. Additionally, eBooks and online course materials can greatly reduce the physical space requirements for traditional textbooks and other teaching materials, resulting in more effective use of classroom resources.
 In conclusion, while there are concerns about the potential negative effects of using tablets and laptops in the classroom, the benefits they offer for academic success cannot be ignored. By allowing students to save time, increase learning efficiency, and improve space efficiency, these devices have become essential tools for modern-day learning. Therefore, I strongly recommend the use of tablets and laptops in the classroom as a way to enhance the learning experience and improve academic performance.",TRUE,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,UNSUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL

Let's take a closer look at your essay and see where we can apply your new knowledge of complex sentences.

First, take a look at your introduction. Is there a sentence in there that you could potentially make more complex by adding a dependent clause? 

Next, look at each of your body paragraphs. Are there any supporting sentences that could benefit from a dependent clause?

When you find a sentence that could benefit from a dependent clause, think about what kind of clause you could add to increase the complexity of the sentence. Would an adjective clause work? Or perhaps an adverb clause?

Remember to make sure that each dependent clause has a subject and a verb, and that it connects logically to the independent clause.

Once you've gone through your essay and identified places where you can add complexity with dependent clauses, go ahead and make those revisions. Then, read through your essay again to make sure that your sentences flow well and that your ideas are clear.

Try to rephrase your thesis statement to make it more specific and clear.

2. Provide more evidence: While you make some good points in your essay, you could strengthen your argument by providing more evidence to support your claims. For example, you mention that high school curriculums don't provide enough knowledge for students to select a major, but you don't provide any specific examples or statistics to back up this claim. Try to find some research or data to support your argument.

3. Use more specific language: In some places, your essay uses vague or general language that could be more specific. For example, you say that students need to learn a variety of subjects, but you don't specify which subjects or why they are important. Try to be more specific in your language to make your argument more persuasive.

4. Consider counterarguments: To make your argument stronger, it's important to consider counterarguments and address them in your essay. For example, some people might argue that a major-free first year of college would be a waste of time and money. Try to anticipate these counterarguments and address them in your essay.

However, during high school, we learn only slightly due to the education system in Korea. Students need to learn a variety of subjects, which only allows them to learn them superficially.  Furthermore, having a major-free first year can help students find their interest. My university, KAIST, uses this system. As per the investment in 2021, almost 50% of the KAIST students revealed that their real majors changed after entering KAIST. Major-free is a highly effective tool in helping students make a more informed choice of their major.  In conclusion, there are many problems with the Korean education system, especially in high school. Due to this reason, it becomes impossible for high school students to choose their majors effectively. Therefore, universities should require the first year of college to be major-free to help students decide their real interests.",FALSE,TRUE,NO-UPTAKE,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL

An independent clause can be a sentence by itself, or two independent clauses can be joined with the conjunctions and, but, or, so, for, yet, and nor. A dependent clause, in contrast, cannot be a sentence by itself. A dependent clause depends on something else to complete its meaning.

1. Read through your essay and identify any clauses that you've used. 
2. Determine whether each clause is an independent clause or a dependent clause. If you come across a dependent clause, try to identify what word or phrase it depends on to complete its meaning. 
3. Ensure that each independent clause is a complete sentence, meaning that it conveys a complete thought on its own. 
4. Check for any run-on sentences, which occur when two independent clauses are joined together without proper punctuation. 
5. Consider using coordinating conjunctions like and, but, or, so, yet, for, or nor to join two independent clauses to create a compound sentence.

 Most universities require freshmen to decide just one major. Double-major or major change are possible, but they have difficult requirement. Most students must study the major by just one decision. However, in my opinion, universities should provide opportunities to be major-free.
 First, students should learn basic skills and common knowledges in the first year of college. Now, society and technology are much developed. There exist too much information, but basic things are not changed. For example, calculus and programing are important in every major. They are essential to analyze something,  so students need to learn basic subjects when they are freshmen.
 Second, freshmen should find their interests and should experience various majors. Freshmen become an adult this year. Their experiences depend on their school life. They have no experience about some majors, so major decision is too early for freshmen.

First of all, I appreciate that you followed some of the guidelines that we learned in class. Now, let's work together to make your essay even better. 

To begin with, let's add a formal tone to your writing. One way we can achieve this is by using more formal language. For instance, instead of “I'm against women joining the army,"" you could say “I oppose women's enlistment in the army."" Also, try to avoid contractions (e.g., it's, can't, wouldn't) and use their full forms instead (e.g., it is, cannot, would not).

Next, let's work on your paragraph transitions. The first sentence of each paragraph is an excellent space to use transition words, just as you mentioned. Hence, try to integrate them into your essay. For example, you could start your second paragraph by saying ""In addition, the military is a closed society, and there is a possibility of crime in it.""

Let's also modify and improve the flow of your paragraphs. For example, the second paragraph could be better placed first before the introduction. It would be better to begin with the physical reasons that support your idea. This change will make the essay flow more concisely.

Lastly, let's refine your content. It can be more precise by giving more structure to your reasoning. For instance, mention and elaborate a little more on one point, then state the next point clearly, and proceed to clarify that as well. Also, avoid using broad statements such as ""many issues"" instead use more specific examples.

Using these tips, can you please revise your essay accordingly?",4,ACK,"I'm against women joining the army. There are some reasons that supporting my idea.

First, let's focus on the second point you make about the possibility of crime in the military. Do you have any sources to support this claim? If so, you could incorporate an in-text citation in this sentence to show where this information came from. 

You also mention ""other discriminatory perceptions"" that can arise from women joining the military. Is there any specific evidence you can provide to back up this claim? Try to find a source and include a works cited entry to list it at the end of your essay.

Here are some suggestions to help you revise your essay based on what you learned in class.

1. Changing nouns to verbs: You can make your sentence clearer by changing the noun ""Measurements"" to a verb as follows: ""A mass spectrometer measured the reaction products."" Can you apply this technique to the 1st sentence of your paragraph?

2. Clarity of sentences: In the second sentence, the phrase ""quite large"" might be vague. It is better to quantify the difference by stating a percentage or exact measurements. Also, try to repeat the word ""difference"" from the previous sentence to enhance the clarity.

3. Use of pronouns: In the third sentence, it is better to use the noun ""training"" instead of using the pronoun ""it"" to avoid ambiguity.

Therefore, here's a revised paragraph that incorporates the above suggestions that you can use as an example for applying changes in the rest of your essay:

<para>""I oppose women's enlistment in the army because of the physical differences between men and women. Such differences are significant, with the gap in physical fitness in their 20s being as high as [insert percentage or measurement]. As a result, it can be challenging to provide the same level of training for both genders. Additionally, the military is a closed society that has been known to have an issue with crime, including sex crimes. For instance, the Ministry of National Defense found that only 32.7% of sex crimes within the military are reported, with the majority of victims not expecting any action to be taken. The fear is that if women are required to join the military, it could result in an increase in crime. Given the current gender-based facilities limitations and other considerations, such as physical differences, the degree of training, and the length of hair, it may take a long time to provide women with the same military experience as men. Therefore, I oppose women's mandatory military enlistment."" </para>

249,20220656-AW-6-1-02,AW,20220656,6,1,2,"<essay>Women's mandatory military enlistment is a topic that raises questions about physical and social differences between men and women. While some may argue that women should have equal opportunities when it comes to serving in the military, I believe that these differences cannot be ignored. One of the primary considerations when it comes to the inclusion of women in the military is the significant gap in average muscle mass between men and women. According to studies, this gap is almost 20%, making it difficult to provide the same level of training for both genders. This means that women may be at a disadvantage when it comes to performing certain physical tasks required in the military.
 In addition,  the military is no stranger to sexual assault and harassment. In fact, the military has been known to cover up such incidents, making it difficult for victims to report them. Recent statistics show that only 32.7% of sex crimes within the military are reported. This creates an environment where soldiers may not feel safe or protected.

Moreover, joining women to the military cannot resolve gender inequality. With women not being allowed in combat roles until recently, the facilities and conditions within the military are not suitable for women to join. There are shortages of women's toilets and other facilities that make it difficult for women to serve alongside men. These limitations serve as a significant barrier to women's participation in the military. Some argue that women's mandatory military enlistment will help solve gender inequality and increase female participation in the military. However, simply allowing women to serve does not address systemic issues within society. Providing equal opportunities is only a small part of addressing gender inequality. It is a band-aid solution that fails to address the root causes of gender-based discrimination.
In conclusion, I believe that women's mandatory military enlistment is not an effective solution to the issue of gender inequality within the military. Physical, social, and cultural differences between men and women cannot be ignored. Until facilities and conditions are equalized for both genders, women's participation in the military must remain voluntary. For this reason, I oppose women's mandatory military enlistment. Of course, it is a pity that men go to the military to support their youth in their young and precious days in their 20s. I think women should live with more respect for men and a heart that contributes to the country.</essay>","Great job! Your thesis statement is clear and concise. However, I noticed that there are some areas in your essay that could be improved. Let's go through each paragraph and see how we can revise them to make your argument stronger.

In the first paragraph, you have a good thesis statement that presents your argument against women's mandatory military enlistment. However, you can improve it by including an opposing point of view. For example, you can rewrite it as follows:

While some argue that women should have equal opportunities to serve in the military, others believe that physical and social differences between men and women cannot be ignored. Despite the fact that women have made significant strides in breaking down gender barriers, the inclusion of women in the military raises questions about their ability to perform certain physical tasks required in the military.

In the second paragraph, you provide statistics about sexual assault and harassment in the military. However, you can improve this paragraph by using transition signals of contrast to include an opposing point of view. For example, you can rewrite it as follows:

Although the military has made efforts to address sexual assault and harassment, recent statistics show that only 32.7% of sex crimes within the military are reported. While some argue that mandatory military enlistment for women will help address this issue, others believe that it may create an environment where soldiers do not feel safe or protected.

In the third paragraph, you argue that the inclusion of women in the military cannot resolve gender inequality. However, you can improve this paragraph by using transition signals of contrast to include an opposing point of view. For example, you can rewrite it as follows:

While some argue that women's mandatory military enlistment will help solve gender inequality and increase female participation in the military, others believe that it is a band-aid solution that fails to address the root causes of gender-based discrimination. Although providing equal opportunities is important, it is only a small part of addressing gender inequality.

In the final paragraph, you restate your thesis statement and provide a conclusion. However, you can improve this paragraph by using transition signals of contrast to include an opposing point of view. For example, you can rewrite it as follows:

While some argue that women's participation in the military should be mandatory, I believe that physical, social, and cultural differences between men and women cannot be ignored. Until facilities and conditions are equalized for both genders, women's participation in the military must remain voluntary. Although it is important to support our country, we must also consider the well-being and safety of our soldiers.

Overall, your essay is well-written, and you have presented a strong argument against women's mandatory military enlistment. By using transition signals of contrast, you can include an opposing point of view and make your argument stronger. Keep up the good work!",4,ACK,"Women's mandatory military enlistment is a topic that raises questions about physical and social differences between men and women. While some may argue that women should have equal opportunities when it comes to serving in the military, I believe that these differences cannot be ignored. One of the primary considerations when it comes to the inclusion of women in the military is the significant gap in average muscle mass between men and women. According to studies, this gap is almost 20%, making it difficult to provide the same level of training for both genders. This means that women may be at a disadvantage when it comes to performing certain physical tasks required in the military.
 In addition,  the military is no stranger to sexual assault and harassment. In fact, the military has been known to cover up such incidents, making it difficult for victims to report them. Recent statistics show that only 32.7% of sex crimes within the military are reported. This creates an environment where soldiers may not feel safe or protected.
 In addition, The military is no stranger to sexual assault and harassment. In fact, the military has been known to cover up such incidents, making it difficult for victims to report them. Recent statistics show that only 32.7% of sex crimes within the military are reported. This creates an environment where soldiers may not feel safe or protected. In other words, only 3 out of 10 people report it. 44% of victims who did not report sex crimes saids, ""No action was likely to be taken."" In other words, soldiers do not trust the military's measures and do not even expected them. Unlike now situation, if two genders have to live in the military, there might be many problems that comes from the difference of two genders in the closed military society. As a result, the crime can be increased. 
Moreover, joining women to the military cannot resolve gender inequality. With women not being allowed in combat roles until recently, the facilities and conditions within the military are not suitable for women to join. There are shortages of women's toilets and other facilities that make it difficult for women to serve alongside men. These limitations serve as a significant barrier to women's participation in the military. Some argue that women's mandatory military enlistment will help solve gender inequality and increase female participation in the military. However, simply allowing women to serve does not address systemic issues within society. Providing equal opportunities is only a small part of addressing gender inequality. It is a band-aid solution that fails to address the root causes of gender-based discrimination.
In conclusion, I believe that women's mandatory military enlistment is not an effective solution to the issue of gender inequality within the military. Physical, social, and cultural differences between men and women cannot be ignored. Until facilities and conditions are equalized for both genders, women's participation in the military must remain voluntary. For this reason, I oppose women's mandatory military enlistment. Of course, it is a pity that men go to the military to support their youth in their young and precious days in their 20s. I think women should live with more respect for men and a heart that contributes to the country.","Women's mandatory military enlistment is a topic that raises questions about physical and social differences between men and women.

This essay is going to compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of online shopping and offline shopping, considering factors such as convenience, variety, interaction, and overall impact on consumers.
One of the key advantages of online shopping is convenience and accessibility. With just a few researching, consumers can browse through a vast array of products and make purchases from the comfort of their own homes. Online shopping eliminates the need for physical travel to stores, saving time and effort. Moreover, online shopping allows shoppers to make purchases at any time they want, as they are typically open 24/7. On the other hand, offline shopping provides an immediate shopping. Shoppers can physically examine and try on products before making a purchase, which is not possible with online shopping. Also, offline shopping offers instant gratification, as consumers can immediately take their purchases home. But, in a different sense, offline shopping requires individuals to visit physical stores during their operating hours, which can be restrictive and inconvenient for those with busy schedules.
Next, Online shopping offers unparalleled variety and selection. E-commerce platforms provide access to products from all around the world, allowing consumers to explore a wide range of options. Online retailers often have extensive inventories, ensuring that shoppers can find products in various sizes, colors, and styles. Also, consumers can easily compare prices, read reviews, and access detailed product information, empowering them to make informed purchasing decisions. In contrast, offline shopping have limited stock and selection, especially in smaller or specialized stores. But offline shopping also have merits in providing the opportunity for consumers to personally inspect products and assess their quality, something that online shopping lacks. Shoppers can touch, feel, and try on items, ensuring their quality, fit, and suitability. This hands-on experience is particularly valuable for items such as clothes, furniture, or electronics. On the contrary, online shopping relies on product descriptions, image, and sometimes customer reviews, which may not always accurately convey the real-life experience of the product.
In addition, interaction and customer service also differ between online and offline shopping. Offline stores provide face-to-face interaction with sales associates who can provide personalized assistance, answer questions, and offer recommendations. This personalized interaction enhances the shopping experience and can help customers make informed purchasing decisions. Offline shopping also provides the opportunity for social interaction, allowing shoppers to engage with friends or family while browsing stores. Online shopping, on the other hand, relies on digital communication channels. Even though customer service is available through online chat or email, the absence of immediate assistance may lead to delays in resolving queries or concerns.
Next is about price comparison. Price comparison is an area where both online and offline shopping have their merits. Online retailers often offer competitive prices due to lower overhead costs, and the ability to compare prices across different platforms is a breeze. In comparison, offline shopping can involve bargaining, taking advantage of sales or discounts, and immediate price negotiations, especially in smaller or local stores. Additionally, offline shopping allows shoppers to avoid shipping costs or waiting periods, which can sometimes be associated with online purchases.
In terms of the overall impact on consumers, shopping experience and returns differs significantly between online and offline shopping. Online shopping offers a convenient and efficient experience, allowing consumers to quickly find products and compare prices. It has provided opportunities for small business and entrepreneurs to reach a wider market. However, it has led to concerns such as cybersecurity risks, potential frauds, and the loss of in-person social interaction. Also, it lacks the sensor experience that offline shopping provides, such as physically touching and trying on items. Offline shopping, while more traditional, still holds its value in terms of personal engagement, immediate gratification, and the ability to support local businesses. Offline shopping offers an immersive experience, allowing shoppers to engage their senses and assess product quality firsthand. Another aspect to consider is the return process. Online shopping often provides hassle-free return, with easy-to-follow procedures and prepaid shipping labels. In contrast, returning items purchased offline may require visiting the store, waiting in line, and complying with specific return policies.
In conclusion, online shopping and offline shopping both have their advantages and disadvantages. Online shopping offers convenience, a extensive variety of products, competitive prices, and the ability to shop anytime anywhere. On the other hand, offline shopping provides the opportunity for sensory engagement, face-to-face interaction between customers and staff, personalized customer service, and immediate gratification. Ultimately, the choice between online shopping and offline shopping depends on individual preferences, the type of product being purchased, and the overall shopping experience desired. As technology continues to advance, the future may see a blending of these two approaches, providing an even more seamless and immersive shopping experience for consumers.",TRUE,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL

But if they have a problem about the pollution that is made by the building right next to restaurant, they can’t do anything regardless of their money. In this situation, government have to help them. Like this, regardless of their background, everyone needs help in their situation.
 Second, the government and the country is made by the citizens. At Korean law, it says ‘the right of Korea lies with the citizens, and all the power comes from the citizens.’ Citizens contribute to make a government and they should be the most important thing for the government. So, regardless of their background government have to protect all citizens.
 Finally, taxes are gained by all the citizens. Moreover, rich people pay more taxes. Of course I think it’s fair can common sense that rich people pay more taxes. But the fact is that all citizens pay taxes. It they pat it but there’s not any help, they will confused about why they pay taxes. So, government should help all people that pay taxes.

I have reviewed it and I noticed a few instances where you could improve your use of commas. Please see the revised essay below with changes highlighted in bold and explanations in italics:

Many people wonder about how the government uses their taxes. There have been many news reports about taxes being used to help people like old individuals who live alone or orphans. However, news sources also report taxes being used strangely for people who don't need help, like the rich people. The question remains: are taxes used only for those in the most need? Based on my opinion, I believe that the government should help all its citizens for three reasons. 

First, everyone needs help. Regardless of their background, people need help for many reasons. For example, those who are rich because of their restaurant may have no control over the pollution caused by the building right next to their restaurant, despite their financial resources. In this situation, the government needs to help them. As such, regardless of their background, everyone needs help in different situations.

Second, the government and the country are made by the citizens. According to the laws of Korea, ""the right of Korea lies with the citizens, and all the power comes from the citizens."" Citizens have helped to create the government, and they should be the most important thing for the government. Therefore, regardless of their background, the government should protect all its citizens. 

Finally, taxes are paid by all citizens. Moreover, rich people pay more taxes. Of course, I think it's common sense that rich people pay more taxes, but the fact is that all citizens pay taxes. If they pay taxes and don't receive any assistance, they may be confused about why they're paying taxes. So, the government should help all people who pay taxes. 

To sum up, all citizens need help and they pay taxes to the government. They are also the most important thing for the government. In my opinion, it is fair that taxes are used to help people in need. However, the government's system should ensure that all citizens can receive assistance when they need it.

","Great job on your essay! Let's evaluate your arguments and grounds to make it stronger.

Your first argument is that everyone needs help, regardless of their background. To support this argument, you use an example of a rich restaurant owner having a problem with pollution. However, this example doesn't quite fit with the argument. It's true that everyone needs help, but the pollution issue is not really about needing help. It's more about needing a solution to a problem that affects everyone. To make your point stronger, you could use a different example that is more clearly about someone in need of help.

Your second argument is that the government should protect all citizens because the citizens are what make up the government. This is a good argument, but it is not clear how it supports your main point that the government should help all citizens. To make this connection clearer, you could explain how protecting citizens is the same as helping them.

Your third argument is that all citizens pay taxes, and therefore the government should help all people who pay taxes. This is a strong argument, but you could make it stronger by providing more evidence or examples to support it. For example, you could explore how taxes are used in other countries, and how this compares to the way taxes are used in your country.

In conclusion, you have some great ideas in your essay, but you could strengthen your arguments and grounds by providing more specific evidence or examples to back up your points.

1. To support your argument that everyone needs help, consider using an example that is more clearly about someone in need of help. For example, you could talk about the elderly or disabled people who may need government assistance for their daily needs, especially if they can't afford to pay for private care.

2. To make the connection between protecting citizens and helping them clearer, you could explain how protecting citizens from harm or danger ultimately is a form of help. For instance, you could explore how laws and regulations help protect people from harmful environmental pollution, unsafe working conditions, or abusive practices in business.

3. To strengthen your argument that all citizens pay taxes and should receive help, you could provide evidence to support this claim. For instance, you could cite specific statistics on how much money is collected in taxes each year and how it is spent, or you could share stories of people who have been affected by the lack of government assistance, despite paying their taxes.

<essay>Many people question how the government uses their taxes. There have been reports that taxes are put to good use to help elderly folks who live alone or orphans in need. However, taxes are also used for purposes that some people feel are unnecessary, like the wealthy. Should the government only spend taxes on those in need? This essay argues that the government should provide support to all its citizens for three reasons.

First, everyone needs assistance at some point in their lives, irrespective of their status. For instance, a restaurant owner who is wealthy may be unable to do anything about the pollution caused by a building next to their restaurant. In such a scenario, the government must aid the individual. This illustrates that everyone requires help sometimes, regardless of their economic status. Additionally, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many small business owners struggled to keep their businesses afloat, reaffirming the necessity of government support to safeguard businesses and the economy.

Second, citizens are the foundation of the government and the country it serves. Korean law enshrines the principle that ""the power of Korea belongs to the people, and all power is derived from the people."" As a result, citizens are the most important aspect of the government. This suggests that the government should protect all citizens, irrespective of their background. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights similarly recognizes that all humans are ""born free and equal in dignity and rights,"" emphasizing the importance of safeguarding the rights and well-being of all citizens.

Finally, all citizens contribute to the generation of taxes, and the wealthy pay a greater percentage of taxes. While it is reasonable and fair that the wealthy pay more taxes, it is important to recognize that all citizens pay taxes. If they pay taxes but receive no assistance, they may become confused about why they contribute taxes. Therefore, the government should provide assistance to all taxpayers.

In conclusion, everyone requires assistance, pays taxes, and is essential to the government. It is reasonable to spend most taxes on individuals in need, but the system must be designed to assist all citizens.</essay>",2,ACK,"Many people wondered about how the government uses their taxes.

I want to say three reasons for why the government should help all of its citizens.
 First, everyone needs help. Regardless of their background, people need help for many reasons. For example, those who are rich because of their restaurant.

In this situation, the government has to help them. Like this, regardless of their background, everyone needs help in their situation.

 Second, the government and the country are made by the citizens.

Let's work on revising and polishing your essay further. 

Firstly, let's improve the introduction. In the first sentence, check your spelling. It should be ""through"" instead of ""throught"". Also, make sure to introduce your topic and thesis statement more clearly. You can rephrase it to something like: ""The Covid-19 pandemic has caused many changes in the educational system, including the increasing use of laptops and tablets for online learning. In this essay, I will discuss three advantages of using these electronic devices for studying.""

Next, let's work on each of your three arguments. Begin each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea you will explore in that paragraph. Then, provide some specific examples or evidence to support your argument. You can also cite some sources to make your argument more convincing.

Moreover, let's work on the coherence and flow of your essay. Make sure that each paragraph is connected to the previous one and the following one. Use transition words and phrases such as ""however"", ""moreover"", and ""in addition"" to signal the relationship between your ideas.

Finally, let's revise your conclusion. Instead of simply summarizing your main points, try to provide a deeper insight or reflection on your argument. You can also suggest some future directions or implications for further research.

This is my essay","Great job on your essay! You have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. However, there are a few areas where you can improve your writing. Let's go through each paragraph and make some revisions.

In your introduction, you have provided a good overview of the topic. However, you can make it more engaging by adding a hook or a thesis statement. A hook can be a question, a quote, or a statistic that captures the reader's attention. A thesis statement is a sentence that summarizes the main point of your essay. It should be clear and concise. For example, you can start your introduction with a hook like this: <sent>""Did you know that the Covid-19 pandemic has revolutionized the way we learn? With the rise of online classes, students are now using laptops and tablets more than ever before. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of using electronic devices for studying.""</sent>

In your first body paragraph, you have discussed the mobility of laptops and tablets. You have made a good point that these devices are lighter than traditional textbooks and notes. However, you can expand on this idea by providing some examples or evidence. For instance, you can mention a study that shows how much weight students can save by using electronic devices instead of books. You can also explain how this mobility can benefit students in different situations, such as commuting or traveling.

In your second body paragraph, you have discussed the ability of laptops and tablets to increase students' studying skills. You have made a good point that these devices can record lectures and make note-taking easier. However, you can improve this paragraph by providing more details on how these features work.

You can also mention some tips on how to use these tools effectively, such as using keywords or tags to categorize information.

In your third body paragraph, you have discussed the connectivity of laptops and tablets. You have made a good point that these devices can help students connect with their peers and teachers. However, you can improve this paragraph by providing more examples of how this connectivity works. For instance, you can mention some online platforms that students can use to collaborate, such as Google Drive or Zoom. You can also explain how teachers can use these platforms to provide feedback or answer questions from students.

In your conclusion, you have summarized your main points and provided a good closing statement. However, you can make it more impactful by adding a call to action or a final thought. A call to action is a sentence that encourages the reader to take action or think about the topic in a different way. For example, you can end your essay with a call to action like this: <sent>""As we embrace the digital era of education, let us not forget the importance of human interaction and critical thinking. By using laptops and tablets wisely, we can enhance our learning experience and prepare ourselves for the challenges of the future.""</sent>

So, UBI should not be considered as a solution.</essay>","Great start! Here are some suggestions for improvement: 

1. Let's start by correcting the grammar and spelling errors. For example, in the first sentence, replace ""nowdays"" with ""nowadays"" and ""lost"" with ""lose."" 

2. You could also try breaking up some of the longer sentences into shorter, more manageable ones. For example, consider splitting the third sentence into two sentences. 

3. Next, let's take a look at the organization of the essay. It might be helpful to start with a brief introduction that provides some background information on the topic, followed by a thesis statement that clearly states your position on UBI. 

4. You mention that UBI has risks and side effects, but it would be helpful to provide more specific examples or evidence to support your argument. 

5. Finally, consider providing some alternative solutions to the problem of job displacement caused by AI. For example, you could discuss training programs or initiatives to encourage the growth of industries that are less vulnerable to automation.

You've presented some interesting arguments against the effectiveness of UBI as a solution to the problem of unemployment due to AI. However, there are a few things that you can improve to make your essay stronger. 

Firstly, you need to address some grammatical errors and typos, so make sure to proofread your essay before submitting. For example, you need to pay attention to capitalization, such as ""goverment,"" which should be ""government."" You also have a misspelling in the second sentence, where ""stuided"" should be ""studied."" 

Secondly, I suggest restructuring and reorganizing your paragraphs to make them more coherent and logical. You start with discussing the problem and then abruptly transition to discussing UBI's two ways of implementation. You should start with a clear introduction, then move to discussing the problem caused by AI, then dive into UBI and its issues. Also, consider combining some of your short paragraphs into longer, more comprehensive ones. 

Lastly, your essay lacks supporting evidence and details, which makes your arguments less convincing. You should aim to add examples, statistics, or anecdotes, to back up your claims. For instance, when you claim that giving UBI to every person would lead to price increases, it would be useful to present some evidence that supports this argument, and explain why that is the case. 

Once you have made these improvements, your essay will become much stronger and more engaging. Good luck with your revisions!",5,ACK,"     Numerous jobs are easily replaced by AI nowdays.

Based on what we have learned in class about compare and contrast writing, there are a few areas in which your essay could be revised and refined. 

Firstly, when writing a compare and contrast essay, it's important to clearly state your thesis, which is your main argument or point. In your essay, it seems like your thesis is that UBI is not a suitable solution to the employment problem caused by AI. However, this thesis is not clearly stated in your introduction. I suggest you rephrase and clarify this thesis statement.

Secondly, it is suggested that you organize your essay by either outlining the characteristics of each of the two topics (in this case, the benefits and drawbacks of UBI) and explaining the similarities and differences, or by exploring how each topic can or cannot be applied to a certain context. In your essay, the benefits and drawbacks of UBI are outlined as separate paragraphs, but they are not directly compared or contrasted with one another. Therefore, it might be helpful to compare each advantage with its corresponding weakness to provide logical support for your thesis.

Thirdly, it would help if you provided specific evidence and examples to support your arguments and show the reader how you arrived at your conclusions. At times, your writing appears vague, and using concrete examples will add strength to your arguments. For example, you mention that ""the government does not have to inject money into society because the total amount of money is constant,"" but you do not provide any evidence to validate this claim.

Lastly, it is advisable to rephrase or eliminate any sentences that are not clear or do not have a solid connection to your topic. For example, the first sentence of your second paragraph could benefit from some rephrasing to make it clearer. 

I hope these suggestions are helpful, and I encourage you to revise your essay while keeping these points in mind.

A conclusion should be a summary of your essay's ideas while leaving your reader with some key takeaways. You want to leave the reader with something to think about and consider. 

Here's an example conclusion for your essay:

<para>In conclusion, it is important that the government provides assistance to citizens based on their situation rather than solely relying on economic criteria. Helping those who are struggling due to circumstances such as illness or personal situations can have a positive impact on the individual's life and the society as a whole. However, over-helping can lead to a neglect of duty and cause social disparities. It is important to remember that someone who works and earns a lot of money should not be forced to ""sacrifice"" due to unfair mandates, and those deserving of assistance should be given the opportunities to succeed. By considering the individual's situation, the government can better support their citizens and create a more inclusive society.</para>

For example, the sentence <sent>""Even individuals who encounter challenging circumstances should be given equal opportunities to improve their situation through hard work""</sent> could be rephrased as <sent>""Individuals who face difficult circumstances should be provided with equal opportunities to improve their situation by working hard.""</sent>

3. In the third paragraph, it's important to explain why over-helping can lead to neglect of duty. Try expanding on this idea with an example or a specific scenario.

Have you ever had to face a difficult situation where you needed help but were denied because of factors beyond your control? When I was growing up, my family struggled through tough financial times, and we often had to rely on government assistance to make ends meet. However, I noticed that those who were seemingly worse off than us were not always receiving aid. This made me question the fairness of the government's support system. Shouldn't those who are truly in need receive assistance regardless of their economic status?

This is my essay.","Great, thank you for sharing your essay. I can see that you have a clear thesis statement and three clear reasons to support your argument. However, I noticed that your conclusion could be stronger in order to leave a lasting impression on your readers and have them think about the main point of your essay after they finish reading it.

Let's work on revising your conclusion. One effective way to end an essay is to restate your thesis statement in a new way and connect it back to the main points you discussed in your body paragraphs. This will show the reader how your argument has been supported and reinforced throughout your essay. 

For example, you could rewrite your conclusion like this:

<para>""In conclusion, the government should not base their support solely on economic status, but rather take into consideration the individual's circumstances and needs. By doing so, those who truly need support can receive it, and those who are capable of standing on their own two feet can do so without hinderance. It is crucial to provide equitable assistance to those in need to ensure a just and fair society. Through hard work and dedication, individuals should be allowed the opportunity to improve their situation. Let us work together to create a society that values and supports its citizens, regardless of their background or economic status.""</para>

Based on your summary, it seems like you have provided some good supporting details for your second main idea, but you could benefit from adding more specific examples or evidence to strengthen your argument. Here are some steps you can take to revise your essay:

1. Review your second main idea and identify the specific points you have made so far. 
2. Think about how you can provide more detail or evidence to support your argument. For example, you could provide specific examples of people who have been denied government assistance despite facing difficult circumstances, or you could research statistics or studies that support your argument.
3. Consider the counterarguments to your position and think about how you can address them. For example, some people might argue that providing support based on individual circumstances is too subjective or difficult to implement. You could address this by providing specific guidelines or criteria for determining who qualifies for assistance based on individual circumstances.
4. Once you have identified areas where you can add more detail or evidence, revise your essay to include this information. Be sure to integrate your new information smoothly into your essay and make sure it supports your overall argument.

295,20220751-AW-2-1-01,AW,20220751,2,1,1,"please look at the essay below, and see if there are tings to change, especially if there are faulty parallelism or faulty comparison

[Should the government help only those in need or should it help all its citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background?]

The government should help only those most in need, because if not, it can lead to some potential problems. The examples and the reasons are written below.

First, if the government helps all its citizens not concerning socioeconomic background, the whole tax burden will increase. Because the number of people the government should help increase when compared with situation when the government only help the poor one, all of the citizens should pay more tax. And by increases tax, the poor one will happen to be more poor even if the government help them.

Second, it government help all the citizens, their motivation to work will decrease. Even if people don't work, the government will give money or food to all the citizens, and then there is no reason to work, because the government will always help them. And ig people don't work, the society won't work, and of course there won't be the money, made by tax, that is used to help the citizens.

For last, when considered realistically, there won't be enough resources to help all the people in the society. Of course it would be nice if everyone can receive support from the government. But that is impossible in our lives. Even though we have the resources and use it to help all the people in the government, that will make the one who desperately need the resource unable to get that resource. And that makes society more polarized.

Overall, providing government help to all of its citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background will withdraw many social. economic problems that we must think about carefully. Though it is right that everyone should be able to be helped at the time they need, but it is also crucial to use limited resources where they are really needed.","Great effort! There are a few revisions that can be made to improve the clarity and coherence of your essay. Let's start with the first paragraph:

- You wrote, ""The government should help only those most in need, because if not, it can lead to some potential problems."" This sentence is incomplete and should be revised to, ""The government should help only those most in need, because if it helps everyone regardless of their socioeconomic background, this could lead to some potential problems.""

Now let's tackle the faulty parallelism in the second paragraph:

- You wrote, ""Even if people don't work, the government will give money or food to all the citizens, and then there is no reason to work, because the government will always help them."" The second clause (""and then there is no reason to work, because the government will always help them"") does not match the structure of the first clause (""Even if people don't work, the government will give money or food to all the citizens""). To make the sentence parallel, you can revise it to, ""Even if people don't work, the government will give money or food to all the citizens, which could lead to decreased motivation to work, as people may believe they do not need to work since the government will always help them.""

Now let's address the faulty comparison in the third paragraph:

- You wrote, ""Of course it would be nice if everyone can receive support from the government. But that is impossible in our lives."" This is a faulty comparison because there is no comparison being made. To make this comparison clear, you can revise it to, ""Of course, it would be nice if everyone could receive support from the government. However, it is impossible to provide support to all citizens, given the limited resources available.""

Lastly, let's revise the concluding paragraph:

- You wrote, ""Overall, providing government help to all of its citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background will withdraw many social. economic problems that we must think about carefully."" This sentence is a bit unclear and could use some revisions for clarity. To make the sentence clear, you can revise it to, ""Overall, while it may seem ideal to provide government help to all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic background, doing so can lead to numerous social and economic problems. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider which individuals truly require government assistance and allocate resources accordingly.""

Remember to proofread your essay thoroughly after making these revisions. Great job! Let me know if you have any questions.",5,R Language Use,,"[Should the government help only those in need or should it help all its citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background?]

You have applied comma rules effectively and your revised essay looks much better. I have a few more suggestions to improve the flow and clarity of your essay:

1. In your second sentence, consider using ""laptops"" instead of ""laptop"" since you are referring to the device in plural rather than singular.

2. In the third sentence, consider using ""classes"" instead of ""class"" since you are again referring to the subject in plural form.

3. In the fourth sentence, consider using ""professors"" instead of ""proffesors"" to correct the spelling mistake.

4. In the seventh sentence, consider using ""opinions and thoughts"" instead of ""opinions and thinkings"" for proper grammar.

5. In the eighth sentence, consider using ""divide"" instead of ""device"" for correct grammar.

First, look for any lists in your essay that have two or more elements. In those cases, make sure that you separate each element with a comma.

Next, check for any other places in your essay where you can use commas. For example, commas can be used to separate clauses in a sentence, to set off phrases that provide additional information, and to separate items in a series.

As you revise your essay, pay close attention to the flow and clarity of your sentences. Make sure that every comma you use serves a clear purpose and helps to convey your meaning.

Some people say that good government should help only those most in need, not normal people or riches, because normal people or riches can live just their own ability. I do not think so about this opinion. I think it should help all of its citizen regardless of socioeconomic back ground.
 First, I think that, because the taxes is not equal. Government takes the tax proporstionally according to whose income. It means that the riches have to tax more than other poors. Of course it should help poor, but if it do not help the riches, then they eventually think that they do not have duty to tax. It is big problem, because the riches are used to tax a lot of money to government. It manage citizen by those money, and eventually bouth of them will effect.
 The other reason is that if government just give help to poor, then anyone do not want to work hard to earn more money. It is same result as communism. Just help for poor people make people to think 'we do not have to work more, because government help more when I am poor'. It decreases whole passion of citizen and it postpond the growth of nation.

The samples were analyzed in as-deposited state, and after 280 °C vacuum annealing for 2 hours. The InOx film on thermal oxide was used as a reference, and was not annealed. Both samples irrespective of annealing showed higher [H]  in the buffer layer region, and it was higher in Al2O3 than SiO2.
In the as-deposited state, the [H] of InOx film was the highest on Al2O3 buffer, which can be attributed to the highest [H] in the Al2O3. The [H] of InOx film was the lowest in the sample with SiO2 buffer, which had the second highest [H]. The hydrogen might be absorbed into the SiO2 layer during deposition.
After annealing, [H] in InOx films decreased. The decrease is most prominent in the sample with Al2O3 buffer, and it became lower than the sample with SiO2. The decrease in both samples can be explained by out-diffusion of hydrogen from the films into the vacuum, and the hydrogen in InOx on Al2O3 buffer might be more unstable than those on SiO2 buffer, causing the drastic decrease in [H] after annealing.
The depth profiles also showed humps at the interface. Since the shapes and locations of the humps differ by the buffer layer composition, the origin is likely be related to the interface properties. Detailed cause of these humps should be investigated further.

<essay>We investigated personality type depending on having siblings for the students in the F class of ‘scientific writing’. As shown in Fig 1., the percentage of only child and one who having siblings is 86.7% and 13.3%, respectively. The percentage of E (extroverted) and I (introverted) is 46.7% and 53.3%, respectively. Actually, this result couldn’t reflect the relationship between the existence of siblings and personality. We have difficult to evaluate hypotheses that having brothers and sisters has an extroverted personality than only child.
For this reason, we retry to examine the individual results as you can see in Fig 2. The number of students of the introverted is 7 and the extroverted is 6 among having siblings, respectively, while the number of students of the introverted is 1 and the extroverted is 1 that exhibited the same number among only child. It is shown that the presence or absence of siblings is not directly related to the personality type (extroverted and introverted)
As a result, it exhibited the hypothesis that having siblings is relatively extroverted than only child. It seems that there are many factors like the environment of growth. And thus, it could not conclude a person’s personality by having brothers and sisters.

Firstly, in the first sentence, consider rephrasing the sentence to ""Our study investigated the relationship between personality types and the presence or absence of siblings among students in the F class of Scientific Writing.""

Secondly, in the third sentence, it would be helpful to provide the actual number of students in the survey, for example ""Out of the total number of students surveyed, 86.7% were only child while 13.3% had siblings.""

Consider rephrasing it to ""However, the results obtained were inconclusive in establishing a relationship between the presence or absence of siblings and personality traits.""

Finally, in the fourth and fifth paragraph, you did a great job of explaining the findings and interpreting the results. However, the sentences could be refined and restructured to enhance clarity. Consider breaking them down into smaller statements, with clear and concise wording.

Also, ferroelectricity additionally demonstrated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning TEM (STEM) analysis.
InGaAs MFS capacitor was fabricated as in Fig. 2(a). First, 500 nm-thick InGaAs layer was epitaxially grown on InP substrate. Then, this III-V wafer was cleansed in a sonicator, using acetone, methanol, and, deionized water subsequently for 5 minutes each. After the removal of native oxide of the InGaAs layer in buffered oxide etch for 10 seconds, the sample was promptly transferred to the CN1 atomic layer deposition (ALD) machine for hafnium-zirconium-oxide (HZO) film growth. 10 nm-thick HZO film was deposited on the InGaAs layer by thermal ALD at 270 °C with Hf : Zr = 1:1 cycle ratio and H2O as oxygen source. Then, a 65 nm-thick molybdenum top electrode was formed by e-beam evaporation. The MFS capacitor was then annealed in RTA with various temperatures in 280 °C ~ 630 °C range in 1 mTorr N2 ambient for 1 minute for HZO crystallization. The temperature precision of RTA was calibrated using Al-Si eutectic point to ensure accurate temperature as in other works [4].

To measure polarization of MFS capacitor, 1 kHz positive-up-negative-down (PUND) measurement with using Keithley 4200A-SCS parameter analyzer to guarantee accurate polarization without dielectric component [5]. Also, the capacitance-voltage characteristic was measured using Keysight 1500A parameter analyzer with frequency range of 10kHz with 30mV oscillation to show defect density of ferroelectric film.
X-ray diffraction analysis for each annealing temperature was conducted for phase analysis of the pristine state, as it is indirect analysis without physically damaging the film. Different phases of HZO film were obtained using RIGAKU high resolution thin-film X-ray diffractometer, with incidence X-ray angle range of 24 ° ~ 65 °.
 HR-TEM and HR-STEM images were obtained to analyze phase transition after electric-field cycling engineering, as it is the only method to inspect phase of ferroelectric film directly [6].

Transformers are indeed effective, albeit computationally heavy, at performing video super-resolution (VSR). Earlier works such as VSR-T [1] merely employed transformer blocks while retaining the same overall framework as existing convolutional or recurrent networks, and many design elements such as elaborate alignment modules also carried over from recurrent models to those early transformer-based models. Later works have since challenged that foundation, such as attempting to remove or greatly simplify the alignment mechanism between different frames,[2] or formulating radical redesigns to self-attention mechanisms.[3] These works serve to optimize transformer designs to suit the characteristics of vsr tasks specifically, where information from multiple distant frames as well as many different regions from the same frame needs to be aggregated for accurate and smooth reconstruction.

Although various model architectures have been tested, no particular transformer design appears to have won out over others, and emerging papers continue to propose wildly varying architectures. This suggests that there is still much room for experimentations on vsr transformer design.

Research on generalization capabilities and overfitting issues of vsr transformer models seems yet to have received the same level of attention as transformers being used for other tasks. Transformer models have a tendency to require much larger training datasets compared to convolutional or recurrent models, and even then they struggle to generalize to forms of degradation or data domains that were not seen during training. [4] As blind super-resolution [5] - the task to reconstruct low-resolution inputs that have been downsampled by arbitrary degradation mechanisms - is a very active field of research for single-image super-resolution, such generalization capability issues need to be tackled down the road.

VSR transformers have evolved to handle large numbers of video frames and aggregate large amounts of information over long spatial and temporal ranges. Design elements that enabled this can also be adapted for other video tasks, such as deblurring, optical flow estimation, or video frame interpolation. However, many design elements will need to be greatly altered to accommodate for their respective target tasks’ own specific needs, like vsr transformers evolved to accommodate for vsr specific characteristics.","Summarizing the above listed papers, we arrive at the following conclusions.

The following subsections describe two auxiliary branches that address the above requirements.

2.1 Representation Summarization (RS)
Vision models learn to summarize input into a dense representation with downsampling operation. More specifically, linearly embedded token [24] or feature map [18, 14] shrinks with downsampling operation as channel size C increases. In order for the intermediate representation to be dense and informative enough, we adapt the perspective from Hu et al. [15], which views a feature map as a collective of local descriptors whose summarized statistics express input. Thus, the Representation Summarization (RS) module is composed of 2d pooling to reduce channel-wise statistics and MLP to learn inter-dependencies between channels. The representation transformed by the MLP layer is activated by sigmoid throughout all experiments, but any other activation function can be applied. The transformed representation is denoted by zˆl = MLP(Pool2d(zl)). (2) Note. For patch representation in works such as [24], the spatial dimension is already mixed in the patch merging step. Therefore, we directly flatten the representation and apply pooling 1d. zˆl = Pool1d(z ′ l )) (3) where z ′ l denotes flattened zl .

2.2 Representation Mixup (RM)
Previous works either use representation extracted from Yim et al. [36] or use weights from layers of pre-trained models by simple averaging [34] or partial selection algorithm [10]. Along the line of this belief, intermediate representation can act as hints for capturing hard false negative samples with simple aggregation methods such as weighted sum or concatenation. The most straightforward method is to mix them in proper portion. We are inspired by several works on data augmentation using interpolation for mixing up in input space or feature space for better representation learning [39, 31]. An interpolation of hidden representations zi , zk with respect to zi is expressed as z ′ = zi + α(zk − zi) (4) where α denotes the scaling factor.

Given pre-trained backbone f, newly initialized linear classifier g, and input image x, the final output score s is s = g ◦ f(x). The final output representation from the pre-trained backbone is f(x) = zL. The pre-trained backbone can be expressed as two parts f(x) = f2 ◦ f1(x) and intermediate representation h can be retrieved while passing partial backbone f1. The final representation z ′ L passed to classifier g can be retrieved as follows: h = f1(x), hˆ = RS(h) ∈ R N , z′ L = hˆ · α + f2(h) · (1 − α) (5) . This means we mixup two elements: intermediate representation and final representation. 

In this paper, following the recent works, we design a learninable parameter α by summarizing the hidden representation into a single value between 0 and 1 as α = σ(W · zL + b). (6) While previous mixup-based works [41, 13] use a beta distribution for α, here we use an auxiliary linear layer to learn the level of mix in an instance-wise manner.</essay>","Overall, your paper is written clearly and concisely.

Previous works either use representation extracted from Yim et al. [36] or use weights from layers of pre-trained models by simple averaging [34] or partial selection algorithm [10]. Along the line of this belief, intermediate representation can act as hints for capturing hard false negative samples with simple aggregation methods such as weighted sum or concatenation. The most straightforward method is to mix them in proper portion. We are inspired by several works on data augmentation using interpolation for mixing up in input space or feature space for better representation learning [39, 31]. An interpolation of hidden representations zi , zk with respect to zi is expressed as z ′ = zi + α(zk − zi) (4) where α denotes the scaling factor.

Given pre-trained backbone f, newly initialized linear classifier g, and input image x, the final output score s is s = g ◦ f(x). The final output representation from the pre-trained backbone is f(x) = zL. The pre-trained backbone can be expressed as two parts f(x) = f2 ◦ f1(x) and intermediate representation h can be retrieved while passing partial backbone f1. The final representation z ′ L passed to classifier g can be retrieved as follows: h = f1(x), hˆ = RS(h) ∈ R ^N , z′ L = hˆ · α + f2(h) · (1 − α) (5) . This means we mixup two elements: intermediate representation and final representation. 

In this paper, following the recent works, we design a learninable parameter α by summarizing the hidden representation into a single value between 0 and 1 as α = σ(W · zL + b)  where σ is sigmoid to clamp the value between 0 and 1 . (6) While previous mixup-based works [41, 13] use a beta distribution for α, here we use an auxiliary linear layer to learn the level of mix in an instance-wise manner.",TRUE,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,UNSUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL

 Porous carbon material derived from carbon dioxide as the reference material for identifying the active site of boron for 2 electron reduction, which is doped with heteroatoms (Boron, Oxygen). As this porous carbon material contains boron and oxygen, which are simultaneously generated when NaBH4 is used as a reducing agent, it would be a suitable reference. To further dope the carbon material with additional oxygen, we used a polymer containing O. The polymer and carbon material were heat-treated together, the polymer would decompose into fragments and oxygen could be doped into the carbon material. To efficiently confirm the effect of oxygen doping, we selected a similar structure polymer without oxygen as the compare group.



1.     Synthesis of carbon materials by converting CO2

 To obtain carbon materials by converting CO2, reducing agent, NaBH4 (Sigma-Aldrich, >99%), was prepared. Placed 2g of NaBH4 in an alumina boat and put in a furnace, raising the temperature to 520°C at a rate of 5°C/min. To prevent the reaction, we flowed inert gas, Ar, at a rate of 55 sccm. When the temperature reached 500°C, replaced Ar with CO2 as a carbon source and maintained the same flow rate of 55 sccm. We maintained the temperature at 500°C for 2 hours for sufficient reaction between CO2 and NaBH4. After waiting for the temperature to cool down, the carbon material was obtained. To remove impurities, washed the obtained carbon material with a 5M HCl solution by stirring at 80°C for 30 minutes and conducting filtration twice. Next, stirred the material in distilled water at 80°C for 30 minutes and filtered it three times. Finally, converted the material to a neutral condition by treating it with an ethanol solution twice. After washing, dried the material at 80°C overnight and obtained the basic carbon material, Boron doped porous carbon (BPC).



2.     Heat treatment of carbon materials with oxygen-containing polymers


 Carbon material obtained from carbon dioxide was modified by conducting thermal treatment with a polymer, polyethylene oxide (PEO, Sigma-Aldrich), which contains oxygen for additional doping. The mixture of the carbon material, BPC, and PEO was prepared in a 1:4 mass ratio (0.1g:0.4g) by mixing with a vortex mixer for 5 minutes to ensure proper mixing. The mixture was then placed in an alumina boat and heated in a furnace with argon gas flowing at a 55sccm and heat rate of 5℃/min up to a temperature of 500°C, which was maintained for 3 hours after reached 500°C. Afterward, the temperature was gradually cooled lowered to room temperature to obtain the material BPC_PEO, which was the result of the thermal treatment of BPC and PEO. The obtained material was subjected to a washing and drying process, which involved placing it in a 5M HCl solution and stirring it for 30 minutes at 80°C, followed by filtration once. Then, the material was stirred in distilled water at 80°C for 30 minutes and filtered twice. Finally, to neutralize the carbon material, the same process was repeated with an ethanol solution once. The washed material was then dried overnight at 80°C and subjected to additional heat treatment to obtain the final carbon material, BPC_PEO.



3.     Heat treatment of carbon materials with non oxygen-containing polymers

 To prepare a comparison group for carbon materials doped with oxygen, a polymer Polyethylene (PE, Sigma-Aldrich) and the basic carbon material BPC with the same structure with PEO but non oxygen polymer were processed together. The process of obtaining the materials including thermal treatment was the same as the previous process. BPC and PE were mixed in a 1:4 ratio (0.1g:0.4g) using a vortex mixer for 5 minutes to ensure proper mixing. The mixture was then placed in an alumina boat and put into a furnace. Argon gas was flowed through the furnace, and the temperature was raised to 500°C at a rate of 5℃/min. When the temperature reached 500°C, it was maintained for 3 hours before being lowered to room temperature to obtain the material BPC_PE, where BPC and PE were co-processed. The obtained material underwent a cleaning process and drying process as follows: it was placed in a 5M HCl solution and stirred at 80 °C for 30 minutes before being filtered once. Then, it was stirred in distilled water at 80 °C for 30 minutes and filtered twice. Finally, to neutralize the carbon material, the solution was converted to an ethanol solution and the same process was repeated once. After washing, the material was dried overnight at 80 °C to obtain the final carbon material, BPC_PE, which was subjected to additional heat treatment.

The catalytic ability of the materials in producing hydrogen peroxide was measured using Rotating Ring Disk Electrode (RRDE) in a three-electrode cell. Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode, and Pt coil electrode was used as the counter electrode and RRDE electrode. Solution consisting of 1 ml ethanol, 0.1 ml 5 wt% Nafion, and 4 mg catalyst was sonicated for 1 hour to disperse the catalyst well, and then 5 ul was dropped to load the catalyst. The electrode with the solution was rotated at 600 rpm for 30 minutes to dry and fix the catalyst on the electrode. LSV(Linear Sweep Voltammetry) measurements were then conducted underusing KOH 0.1M and Na2SO4 0.1M solutions as an electrolyte at a scan rate of 10 mV/s to test the performance of the catalyst with rotating 1600rpm. The actual current resulting from oxygen reduction was calculated as the difference between measurements taken in an argon-saturated solution initially and an oxygen-saturated solution subsequently.

Methodology

In this study, we propose an efficient design methodology for high bandwidth memory (HBM) interposer using a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based eye diagram estimation technique. The methodology consists of several steps, including raw data generation, target channel and design parameters set-up, eye diagram simulation set-up, preprocessing of training datasets, determining the number of labels and eye diagram datasets, time series to images transformation methods for input datasets, and building Pix2Pix-based GAN for eye diagram estimation.
The process of raw data generation for GAN model training involves several steps, starting with the design specifications of HBM and the definition of the target channel. The design of the HBM interposer and the set-up of design parameters are then carried out, followed by the electromagnetic (EM) simulation of the HBM interposer, S-parameters, and eye diagram. Data collection is performed for training the GAN model. The target channel and design parameters are set up based on the physical dimension and material properties of the HBM interposer. The design target is defined as a victim of a 5mm strip line with adjacent aggressors, and the target channel is designed by fixing the thickness of all layers as 1 um.

Methodology

In this study, we propose an efficient design methodology for high bandwidth memory (HBM) interposer using a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based eye diagram estimation technique. The methodology consists of several steps, including raw data generation, target channel and design parameters set-up, eye diagram simulation set-up, preprocessing of training datasets, determining the number of labels and eye diagram datasets, time series to images transformation methods for input datasets, and building Pix2Pix-based GAN for eye diagram estimation.
The process of raw data generation for GAN model training involves several steps, starting with the design specifications of HBM and the definition of the target channel. The design of the HBM interposer and the set-up of design parameters are then carried out, followed by the electromagnetic (EM) simulation of the HBM interposer, S-parameters, and eye diagram. Data collection is performed for training the GAN model. The target channel and design parameters are set up based on the physical dimension and material properties of the HBM interposer. The design target is defined as a victim of a 5mm strip line with adjacent aggressors, and the target channel is designed by fixing the thickness of all layers as 1 um.

Results
The study aims to design an efficient High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) Interposer with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-Based Eye Diagram Estimation, considering power noise. The principles of GAN training were analyzed through the objective function, and the analysis of the training progress of GAN was conducted through discriminator and generator error.

Regarding the principles of GAN training, it was found that binary cross-entropy can be applied to the discriminator in GANs, as the discriminator in GANs is a binary classification problem representing true as 1.0 and false as 0.0. It was also observed that cross-entropy can be greater than 1.0 with logarithmic calculations, providing much greater feedback on the wrong answer. The ideal Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss is 0.693 in situations where the discriminator and generator are balanced.

In the analysis of training progress of GAN, it was noted that according to the mathematical definition of binary cross-entropy, the ideal value of the loss function is ln 2. If the error of the discriminator is less than the ideal value, the discriminator outpaces the generator, and if it is similar to the ideal value, the generator is being trained well. It was found that the error in the discriminator is oscillated in between, indicating that the discriminator and generator compete with each other and learn well.

Designers can freely add, resize, move, and delete references for their design projects on the system. Users can also group references based on their specific goals. Then, the system provides three key features: (1) feature extraction, (2) feature integration, and (3) visualization.
The first feature is feature extraction, where the system extracts design-related features from the references. The system can extract layout, semantic objects, color schemes, and typography. To extract the layout and semantic objects from the reference, we used semantic segmentation model called IBM MAX-Object-Detector. Based on the segmented result, we trained Transformer-based model to get the hierarchical relationship between the objects and detect the layout. Python module called extcolors was used to extract the color scheme from the image, and font recognition open source code called DeepFont is used for font style extraction. These extracted features are then merged based on the reference group and displayed on the interface. When the user clicks on a specific reference, the extracted features for that image are displayed. Additionally, for groups of references, the system displays the common features shared by the images in the same group, enabling users to quickly identify the commonality of the group. CreativeConnect includes a search function that allows users to select specific design keywords or concepts and highlight reference images on the board based on those keywords. This function enables users to quickly discover new groups of references that they may not have considered before, expanding their ideation possibilities.
CreativeConnect provides feature integration, a unique feature to support designers in their ideation process. The system suggests novel and valuable connections between different design features extracted from references. Using collaborative filtering technique, the system suggests connections between different design features that are extracted from various references. The model selects the best connections based on the user's preference for the level of serendipity. Higher levels of serendipity lead to more recommendations of connections between unrelated features, and vice versa. Designers can choose to accept or reject the suggestions, and the system will continue to learn and refine its recommendations based on the user's feedback. This feature enables users to break free from their usual patterns and discover new possibilities for their designs.
The visualization feature in CreativeConnect allows designers to test and visualize the connections they select from the previous step, feature integration.

They aimed to create a design that aligned well with the given topic, looked visually appealing, and stood out from existing designs. Based on these three goals, we analyzed how participants accomplish these goals using visual references in three separate ideation stages, which are reference search, idea generation, and narrowing down.
During the reference search stage, we observed various strategies to stimulate novelty and creativity. Two of the six participants intentionally used general search terms to discover diverse results instead of topic-specific keywords. A different participant obtained references from a field unrelated to brand design, specifically interior design. Three participants used generative models in the hopes that the randomness of AI would lead to new ideas. As visual styles are difficult to explain in words, three out of six participants used recommendation functions for styles instead of formulate them as search keywords. They discovered one of the random images with a style they liked, and then proceeded with the further exploration by getting recommended images similar to the original image. After searching for references, all participants categorized them using their own criteria. These criteria were frequently divided into two categories: style-related keywords and topic-related keywords.
In the idea generation stage, participants employed two primary strategies. The first is to extract the commonness from multiple references. Five participants grouped the topic-related references and discover effective ways to convey topics by extracting common objects. For example, P3 said, “Looking at various references related to travel, I discovered that travel hats appeared frequently, and I decided to use this.” Three participants discovered the specific design elements (e.g., font, color) from the group of references that they liked, and decided to use this for their own design as well. However, this commonness sometimes affects their design in an opposite way. Two of the participants said that they aimed to identify and avoid design styles that were too common. The second strategy was to merge multiple references. Participants divided the topic into keywords, found references for each of them, and merged them together. They changed particular elements from a favorite reference to another element that can highlight the topic more effectively. They also combined references for different design elements, such as typography and color, and applied design elements from other references to a favorite reference.
After generating a range of design concepts, the participants utilized visual references to build prototypes quickly and narrow their choices down. We observed that four participants utilized their references to validate their design concepts by confirming if several references complemented each other and if the design would appear visually appealing after developing this design concept. Additionally, two participants mentioned utilizing references to compare diverse design concepts by taking distinct design elements and implementing them interchangeably.
Based on the interview after the ideation task, we identified various needs when utilizing references in design ideation. In terms of reference search, designers expressed a desire for a search function based on reference groups, rather than recommendations from single references. They also sought a tool to provide references for non-existent or abstract concepts, in addition to a recommendation system for specific design elements, like font, layout, and color. During the idea generation phases, designers desired a tool to automatically extract common design elements from their reference groups, as well as to modify specific parts of references to create new design variations. However, during the narrowing-down phase, we observed a lack of systems to support this aspect of the ideation process. These observations suggest an opportunity for developing computational tools to aid designers in the different stages of ideation.
In summary, this formative study aimed to investigate the strategies employed by designers when using different references together to generate creative ideas. The study found that designers tend to group multiple references according to their own criteria and utilize them as a collective source of inspiration rather than relying on a single reference. During the ideation process, designers extract common elements from their reference groups to guide their design direction, or merge multiple references to create new and creative design ideas. References are used as both a source of direction and stimulus for generating divergent ideas and as a material for making design decisions during the convergent phase. The study also revealed a need for a reference search tool that can provide references for non-existent or abstract concepts, as well as a recommendation system that can provide granular suggestions for different design elements.

Well done on learning about this topic!",5,Answer,,"Text-to-speech (TTS) systems synthesize raw speech waveforms from given text through several components. With the rapid development of deep neural networks, TTS system pipelines have been simplified to two-stage generative modeling apart from text preprocessing such as text normalization and phonemization. The first stage is to produce intermediate speech representations such as melspectrograms (Shen et al., 2018) or linguistic features (Oord et al., 2016) from the preprocessed text,1 and the second stage is to generate raw waveforms conditioned on the intermediate representations (Oord et al., 2016; Kalchbrenner et al., 2018). Models at each of the two-stage pipelines have been developed independently. Neural network-based autoregressive TTS systems have shown the capability of synthesizing realistic speech (Shen et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019), but their sequential generative process makes it difficult to fully utilize modern parallel processors. To overcome this limitation and improve synthesis speed, several non-autoregressive methods have been proposed. In the text-to-spectrogram generation step, extracting attention maps from pre-trained autoregressive teacher networks (Ren et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2020) is attempted to decrease the difficulty of learning alignments between text and spectrograms. More recently, likelihood-based methods further eliminate the dependency on external aligners by estimating or learning alignments that maximize the likelihood of target mel-spectrograms (Zeng et al., 2020; Miao et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020). Meanwhile, generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) have been explored in second stage models. GAN-based feed-forward networks with multiple discriminators, each distinguishing samples at different scales or periods, achieve high-quality raw waveform synthesis (Kumar et al., 2019; Bi´nkowski et al., 2019; Kong et al., 2020). Despite the progress of parallel TTS systems, two-stage pipelines remain problematic because they require sequential training or fine-tuning (Shen et al., 2018; Weiss et al., 2020) for high-quality production wherein latter stage models are trained with the generated samples of earlier stage models. In addition, their dependency on predefined intermediate features precludes applying learned hidden representations to obtain further improvements in performance. Recently, several works, i.e., FastSpeech 2s (Ren et al., 2021) and EATS (Donahue et al., 2021), have proposed efficient end-to-end training methods such as training over short audio clips rather than entire waveforms, leveraging a mel-spectrogram decoder to aid text representation learning, and designing a specialized spectrogram loss to relax lengthmismatch between target and generated speech. However, despite potentially improving performance by utilizing the learned representations, their synthesis quality lags behind two-stage systems. In this work, we present a parallel end-to-end TTS method that generates more natural sounding audio than current two-stage models. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2014), we connect two modules of TTS systems through latent variables to enable efficient end-to-end learning. To improve the expressive power of our method so that high-quality speech waveforms can be synthesized, we apply normalizing flows to our conditional prior distribution and adversarial training on the waveform domain. In addition to generating fine-grained audio, it is important for TTS systems to express the one-to-many relationship in which text input can be spoken in multiple ways with different variations (e.g., pitch and duration). To tackle the one-to-many problem, we also propose a stochastic duration predictor to synthesize speech with diverse rhythms from input text. With the uncertainty modeling over latent variables and the stochastic duration predictor, our method captures speech variations that cannot be represented by text. Our method obtains more natural sounding speech and higher sampling efficiency than the best publicly available TTS system, Glow-TTS (Kim et al., 2020) with HiFiGAN (Kong et al., 2020).

In the text-to-spectrogram generation step, extracting attention maps from pre-trained autoregressive teacher networks (Ren et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2020) is attempted to decrease the difficulty of learning alignments between text and spectrograms. More recently, likelihood-based methods further eliminate the dependency on external aligners by estimating or learning alignments that maximize the likelihood of target mel-spectrograms (Zeng et al., 2020; Miao et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020). Meanwhile, generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) have been explored in second stage models. GAN-based feed-forward networks with multiple discriminators, each distinguishing samples at different scales or periods, achieve high-quality raw waveform synthesis (Kumar et al., 2019; Bi´nkowski et al., 2019; Kong et al., 2020). Despite the progress of parallel TTS systems, two-stage pipelines remain problematic because they require sequential training or fine-tuning (Shen et al., 2018; Weiss et al., 2020) for high-quality production wherein latter stage models are trained with the generated samples of earlier stage models. In addition, their dependency on predefined intermediate features precludes applying learned hidden representations to obtain further improvements in performance. Recently, several works, i.e., FastSpeech 2s (Ren et al., 2021) and EATS (Donahue et al., 2021), have proposed efficient end-to-end training methods such as training over short audio clips rather than entire waveforms, leveraging a mel-spectrogram decoder to aid text representation learning, and designing a specialized spectrogram loss to relax lengthmismatch between target and generated speech. However, despite potentially improving performance by utilizing the learned representations, their synthesis quality lags behind two-stage systems. In this work, we present a parallel end-to-end TTS method that generates more natural sounding audio than current two-stage models. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2014), we connect two modules of TTS systems through latent variables to enable efficient end-to-end learning. To improve the expressive power of our method so that high-quality speech waveforms can be synthesized, we apply normalizing flows to our conditional prior distribution and adversarial training on the waveform domain. In addition to generating fine-grained audio, it is important for TTS systems to express the one-to-many relationship in which text input can be spoken in multiple ways with different variations (e.g., pitch and duration). To tackle the one-to-many problem, we also propose a stochastic duration predictor to synthesize speech with diverse rhythms from input text. With the uncertainty modeling over latent variables and the stochastic duration predictor, our method captures speech variations that cannot be represented by text. Our method obtains more natural sounding speech and higher sampling efficiency than the best publicly available TTS system, Glow-TTS (Kim et al., 2020) with HiFiGAN (Kong et al., 2020).

We find that husbands who work a similar number of hours (Husband = Wife), or lower number of hours (Husband < Wife) than their wives, are less likely to decrease their share in household labor, compared to husbands who work longer hours than their wives (Husband > Wife). Equal earning levels between the spouses also seem to reduce the likelihood for husbands to decrease their share of housework in the course of marriage (model 3b). For couples with an “atypical” female provider earnings ratio (Husband < Wife) the effect is not significant, however. It appears that a winning margin in economic resources does more for the husband than for the wife when housework is redistributed. 
	We also looked at the effects of family formation on the gender division of household tasks to assess how shifts in economic resources play in this context (Table 2). We found a pronounced and significant effect for both directions of change. During the first year after childbirth, fathers seem to be about twice as likely to decrease their contribution to housework. In the same period, fathers’ likelihood to increase their share in housework is reduced by almost 50 percent, compared to childless men. 
	This push towards a more traditional division of housework seems to come to a halt when the youngest child reaches age two. We found no indication, however, that parents readjust back to a more egalitarian division of housework when kids grow older and mothers return to their previous jobs. The time-varying economic indicators (models 2ab and 3ab) do not seem to explain these processes at all. Here, we need to be cautious not to interpret lack of significance in the economic indicators as lack of relevance, especially since the share of parents in the “non-traditional” resource categories is low. The number of mothers out-earning or working longer hours than their husbands is small in this sample, and the share of continuously working mothers is low.","To explore the forces behind the strong tendency of husbands to decrease their share of housework, and the low tendency to increase their share of housework in the course of marriage, we looked at the finds from the multivariate event-history models.

""</essay> in terms of removal of the four common problems?","Based on what we discussed in class, here are some suggestions for revising the three paragraphs you provided:

1. Make sure all of the essential components of the results section are present. The first paragraph has the key components, but the second and third paragraphs could benefit from more explicit statements of research questions, hypotheses, and findings.

2. Avoid including irrelevant or peripheral information. The first paragraph is focused on the research question and key findings. However, the second and third paragraphs may include some information that is not directly related to these findings and could be removed or rephrased to better support the main points.

3. Include enough details to support your findings, but don't include excessive experimental details that are not relevant or important to your results. This seems to be done adequately in the paragraphs provided.

4. Avoid making comparisons, speculations, or conclusions beyond what the results can support. This also seems to be done adequately in the paragraphs provided.

Here are some suggested revisions that address the common problems:

To explore the gender division of housework in couples and the forces behind the low tendency of husbands to increase their share of housework, we used multivariate event-history models. In our study, we investigated the impact of economic resources on changing the division of housework between couples over the course of marriage. We found that husbands who work similar or lower hours than their wives are less likely to decrease their share in household labor, as compared to husbands who work longer hours than their wives. We also found that equal earning levels between spouses reduce the likelihood of husbands decreasing their share of housework in the course of marriage, while ""atypical"" female provider earnings ratios have no significant effect. 

To assess shifts in economic resources and how they may affect family formation, we examined how family formation affects the gender division of household tasks. During the first year after childbirth, fathers are about twice as likely to decrease their contribution to housework, and their likelihood of increasing their share in housework is reduced by almost 50 percent, as compared to childless men. After the youngest child reaches age two, the trend towards a more traditional division of housework comes to a halt. Our results do not show any significant readjustment towards a more egalitarian division of housework when kids grow older and mothers return to their previous jobs. 

It is important to note that the lack of significance in the time-varying economic indicators does not invalidate their potential relevance. The small share of mothers out-earning or working longer hours than their husbands is a limitation of our study, but should not diminish the possible importance of economic resources in shaping dynamics of housework division between couples.

4.1 Algorithm Performance Evaluation
In this study, a Joint-Optimization approach for QoE and confidentiality in Intelligent Drone Edge Computing (JOIDEC) algorithm has been proposed. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, experiments were conducted under various environmental conditions. The experimental results show a comparable algorithm performance to existing methods that did not consider confidentiality.

Fig. 1 illustrates the performance comparison between the proposed approach and existing methods. The X-axis represents the target latency, and the Y-axis represents the processed fps. Consequently, it can be confirmed that the proposed approach achieves a similar performance to existing methods.

4.2 Confidentiality Assurance through Intermediate Result Transmission
In this study, we presented a method to ensure confidentiality through the transmission of intermediate results (IR). This method allows for more efficient confidentiality assurance by transmitting the intermediate results generated at each edge node to the next edge node, rather than transmitting all data at once.

Fig. 2 Intermediate image on each partition point (No result yet)
Fig. 2 shows the impact of the intermediate result transmission method on confidentiality. The X-axis represents the size of the transmitted data, and the Y-axis represents the confidentiality metric. As a result, it can be confirmed that the intermediate result transmission method ensures higher confidentiality compared to the method of transmitting all data at once.

4.3 DNN Partitioning
In this study, we achieved co-optimization of QoE and confidentiality in edge computing environments using DNN partitioning. DNN partitioning allows for the simultaneous improvement of QoE and confidentiality by dividing the entire model into multiple sub-models, which can be independently processed at each edge node.

Fig. 3 Confidentiality at each partition point (No result yet)
Fig. 3 demonstrates the impact of DNN partitioning on QoE and confidentiality. The X-axis represents the number of sub-models, and the Y-axis represents the metrics of QoE and confidentiality, respectively. As a result, it can be confirmed that both QoE and confidentiality are improved as the number of sub-models increases.

4.4 Conclusion
The proposed co-optimization approach for QoE and confidentiality in intelligent drone edge computing (Lyapunov optimization) demonstrated higher performance compared to existing methods that did not consider confidentiality. Additionally, successful co-optimization of QoE and confidentiality was achieved through confidentiality assurance via intermediate result transmission and DNN partitioning. These results demonstrate the need for a new approach considering both QoE and confidentiality in edge computing environments for intelligent drones and provide an essential foundation for future research.","4.

4.3 DNN Partitioning
In this study, we achieved co-optimization of QoE and confidentiality in edge computing environments using DNN partitioning. DNN partitioning allows for the simultaneous improvement of QoE and confidentiality by dividing the entire model into multiple sub-models, which can be independently processed at each edge node.

Fig. 3 Confidentiality at each partition point (No result yet)
Fig. 3 demonstrates the impact of DNN partitioning on QoE and confidentiality. The X-axis represents the number of sub-models, and the Y-axis represents the metrics of QoE and confidentiality, respectively. As a result, it can be confirmed that both QoE and confidentiality are improved as the number of sub-models increases.

4.4 Conclusion
The proposed co-optimization approach for QoE and confidentiality in intelligent drone edge computing (Lyapunov optimization) demonstrated higher performance compared to existing methods that did not consider confidentiality. Additionally, successful co-optimization of QoE and confidentiality was achieved through confidentiality assurance via intermediate result transmission and DNN partitioning. These results demonstrate the need for a new approach considering both QoE and confidentiality in edge computing environments for intelligent drones and provide an essential foundation for future research.",FALSE,TRUE,NO-UPTAKE,TRUE,NO-UPTAKE,TRUE,NO-UPTAKE,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,UNSUCCESSFUL

If the accumulation of muscle fatigue is not resolved, it will lead to overwork, and muscle damage and even threatens human health[4].
	Investigating the musculoskeletal system of human is challenging because of the complexity of the interactions between biological and neurological factors[5]. There are many factors that affect muscle fatigue including the length and volume change of muscle, imbalance of intramuscular chemical components, and some other neurological impairment. Although it is almost impossible to determine the proportion of each factor, all factors can contribute to muscle fatigue, and it can partially explain why it is challenging to represent the muscle model analytically.
	Many studies have proposed the muscle fatigue models to predict and analyze muscle fatigue and recovery. Various approaches have been used to develop muscle fatigue models. The first muscle fatigue model was proposed by Rohmert[6], introducing the relationship between the percentage of maximum muscle exerted and endurance time during static contraction. It showed that if the force exerted is less than 15% MVC, the muscle can sustain indefinitely. A fatigue model based on the Ca2+ cross-bridge mechanism was proposed and verified via a simulation experiment[7]. However, there were too many parameters to consider, which required a huge amount of calculation.
	Like this, muscle fatigue models have been developed before, but some adapt to the static condition, and others are limited to be dynamic motions. Thus, a generalized muscle fatigue and recovery model that is computationally friendly and reflects the physiological change needs to be developed.
	This study aimed to develop a muscle fatigue model that can be applied to dynamic fatigue tasks with physiological changes caused by muscle fatigue. The model was based on an existing muscle model with several muscle parameters. The overall process will be divided into several detailed objectives: First, proper muscle parameters were identified to express muscle fatigue and recovery based on the existing muscle model. Second, muscle fatigue and recovery were quantified by performing an experiment to determine the muscle model parameters.","Muscle fatigue is usually defined as 'a reduction in maximum force'[1].

For complete paraplegic patients, the motor torque of the wearable robot is the only internal torque of the combined human-robot system and
generates the motion of the human-robot. In the case of incomplete paraplegia, the joint
torque generated by the human and the motor torque of the robot are combined to create
the movement of the human body and the robot. Interaction torque is the assistive torque
received by humans. In this paper, we introduce a soft pneumatic muscle sensor system that
can measure the interaction torque between a human and a wearable robot. The system was
embedded in the fabric bands of the wearable robot Angel Legs to measure muscle activity
and interaction torque during robot operation. As a preliminary study, we propose a knee joint
torque experiment. Additional research progress and experimental results will be presented at
the conference session.","A soft force measurement unit based on air pressure with an extensive measurement range was proposed in this paper. sFMU consists of silicone rubber embedding three air sacs that can measure internal pressure. We made it easier to fabricate air sacs without leakage of air by using polyurethane film and thermal bonding film with a high-frequency welding machine.
The size of sFMU is 50×50×20mm which is small enough for application in human movement. The force measurement range verified in this paper is about 160N on the z-axis and 15N in the x- and y-axis force.
Numerous soft multi-axis force sensors have been suggested by researchers. These sensors utilize electric principles, such as the Hall effect or metal resistivity, and incorporate electric components like magnets or microchannels containing liquid conductors [1, 2]. These sensors are capable of measuring forces below 10N. In a different approach, Choi et al. proposed a design employing three radially positioned pneumatic chambers, where pressure is correlated with the applied force [3]. Nevertheless, this design also has limitations regarding its measurement range. Considering the range of the multi-axis force sensor for comparison, the proposed sFMU can have a larger scale of force measurement. This means that sFMU has a high potential for use in various human motion analyses such as measuring ground reaction force.
Although it has a lot of advantages in force measurement in human-robot interactions and human motion analysis, there might be the possibility to improve the sFMU. It is possible that the nonlinearity of the z-axis force of sFMU comes from the sensor's elasticity and the air sac's restoring time. This can lead the calibration equation to be quadratic. This means that the calibration matrix of the z-axis force is a 3×6 matrix with 6 state variables which is each sensor value and its squared value. This can be improved for better calculation computing. Compensation for the nonlinearity can be processed by modeling the sFMU considering its elasticity. Next, obtaining the calibration equation must be done for each sensor unit. This can be improved by making the environment of each air sac the same, introducing a new algorithm, or using machine learning for nonlinear regressions. The potential applications of sFMU extend beyond artificial skin or flexible human-computer interaction devices. It is also anticipated to be utilized in motion analysis and force-based balance control for wearable robots and devices.",TRUE,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,UNSUCCESSFUL

Could you please tell me specifically what you learned in the scientific writing class?",3,R Revision,"Transformers (TFs) are commonly used in radio frequency (RF) CMOS circuits for an impedance-matching purposes [1-8]. TFs are designed by these iterative procedures: 1) design an ideal impedance matching circuit (MC) with passive elements (i.e., resistor, inductor, capacitor); 2) verify whether the ideal impedance MC operates appropriately; 3) transform the ideal impedance MC to a TF layout based on electromagnetic (EM) theory; 4) verify whether the TF layout operates appropriately using EM simulation. However, these procedures are very iterative and time-consuming because it needs lots of EM simulations due to the inaccuracy of theoretical models from the parasitic elements’ distributed behavior [9].
Many researchers have tried to study circuit auto-synthesis platforms for analog and digital circuits. [10, 11] used genetic algorithms to select topology and make compact layouts. An auto-synthesis tool for operational amplifiers was developed using a feedforward neural network (NN) that uses a genetic algorithm [12]. There were many automated circuit synthesis techniques not only for analog and digital circuits but also for RF circuits. In order to extract the equivalent circuit of a spiral inductor, a least-fitting algorithm was proposed in [13]. Moreover, for designing tunable inductors, analysis and simulation of inductors and TFs for integrated circuits were presented [14, 15]. A multilayer perceptron lets us predict square microstrip spiral inductors’ operation [16]. The concept of space mapping with a knowledge-based NN was proposed to synthesize microstrip bandpass filters [17]. In [18-20], for the synthesis of LC filters or microstrip filters, an NN was researched with electrical performance (input) and appropriate layout (output). Inverse modeling reduces iterative tasks in design procedure of TFs [21, 22].
A novel automated matching circuit synthesizer (AMCS) is proposed in the article to simplify the time-consuming process of synthesizing MCs for single-stage amplifiers in RF applications. Instead of manually synthesizing MCs, the AMCS uses an NN to determine the layout of MCs consisting of a TF and two shunt capacitors to meet the required performance, such as output impedances. The AMCS uses two NN cores, where the first core generates multiple layout candidates that can potentially match the core transistors to 50 ohms. The second core calculates the performance of the amplifier with the suggested MCs. The designer looks up the estimated performance and considers other design factors which NN cannot consider and choose a prefer MC candidate. MC’s output impedance and layout compose the one-to-many relationship which can be problem in NN training. To address one-to-many relationship, we utilize input feature that composed of TF's quality factor (Q-factor) and insertion loss (IL). Because core transistor cannot be matched to 50 ohms without shunt capacitor, this work assumes the MCs are generalized to consist of a TF and a pair of shunt capacitors. The AMCS employs the concept of human-in-the-loop (HITL), where the designer retains control over the design process and selects the most suitable MC layout. The AMCS significantly reduces the time required to synthesize MCs, and the article presents MC design examples for single-stage amplifiers operating at different frequencies from 28 GHz to 70 GHz or in different bandwidths from 10% to 32.5%. These examples showcase the AMCS's effectiveness and potential to transform the MC synthesis process for single-stage amplifiers in RF applications.","Transformers (TFs) are commonly used in radio frequency (RF) CMOS circuits for an impedance-matching purposes [1-8].

Overview
The study is testing the company’s ESG commitment and the attributes of the CEO while controlling some variables that could affect this relationship, mainly the supervising board and CEO’s respective responsibilities regarding ESG matters of the firm.
Sample
The sample used for this study is collected from the Carbon Disclosure Project database of 2020 (CDP 2020). CDP collected data about the CEO’s responsibilities, board positions, and carbon emissions from over 4000 companies from several countries. The details about the CEO education attributes not included in the CDP database are collected from public sources, including companies' annual reports or LinkedIn profiles.
Survey Structure
The companies were asked to fill out a form with questions about their carbon emissions, governance structure, and the CEO’s responsibility.
For the governance structure, companies were asked to provide details about the department supervising the ESG-related matters, whether it is a specific board or an executive member. This data helps us control the influence of other executive members on CEO decisions.
As for the CEO’s responsibility, the questionnaire included inquiries about the CEO’s role in ESG-related matters and whether they are directly or indirectly reported to him.
Regarding carbon emissions, the companies were asked to report their yearly emissions number and indicate their level of engagement in reducing them. This data helps measure the dependent variable of our model.
The CDP database did not include details about the CEO education attributes our study focuses on. Therefore, we had to collect them individually through publicly available sources. We quantified whether the CEO studied abroad and the presence or absence of ESG awareness in their educational background. This helps us measure the independent variable of our study.</para>","Overall, your methodology paragraph is well-structured and provides a clear overview of the study's design.

This would help readers understand why these sources are appropriate for your study and how the data you collected from them will be useful for your analysis.

2. Data Collection: It would be helpful to further explain the process of how you collected and analyzed the data. For example, were the surveys sent to all the companies in the CDP database, or were they randomly selected? How did you decide which companies to include in your sample? Additionally, how did you manage missing data and ensure the accuracy of the data collected?

3. Limitations: It's important to acknowledge any limitations of your study. For example, are there any potential biases in the CDP database or public sources that could affect the validity of your findings? Are there any other variables that you were unable to control for in your analysis? Acknowledging limitations can help readers understand the strengths and weaknesses of your study.

This study focuses on the role of anterior cingulate Cortex (ACC) in audiovisual multisensory integration and its potential involvement in auditory dominance in mice facing cognitive conflict scenarios.

Experimental Model Details
Approval from KAIST Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee was obtained for all procedures. Mice of both sexes aged P40-P120 were used for this study. Experiments were performed on wild type (WT, C57BL/6J n=[number]) male and female mice. Subjects were housed under light (starting at 8am) and dark (starting at 8 pm) cycle in single cages with food (mouse chow) available at will. Weight loss of no more than 10% of the initial weight was approved for experiments. 

Dual Retrograde Tracing
Mice of age P50-90 were lightly anesthesized with isoflurane and set on a stereotaxic device (David Kopf Instruments). Throughout the surgery the mice were kept under 1.0-1.5% isoflurane in oxygen, and on a heating pad to maintain the body temperature. After ensuring proper anaesthesia through toe pinch reflex, the mice were head fixed with ear bars and eyes were covered in Vaseline to avoid dryness. The hair on the head was removed with hair removal cream, and the scalp was opened with a single cut down the middle. After removal of periosteum and cleaning of the skull (with ethanol and 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) the target areas were marked on the right hemisphere in reference to Bregma and Lambda. The coordinates used were AP +0.50 ML -0.20 DV -1.00 for ACC and AP -1.94 ML -.1.90 DV -0.40 for posterior parietal cortex (PPC), decided using Paxinos Atlas and Allen Brain Atlas (1, 2). Small craniotomies of 0.1 mm diameter were made over the target coordinates. Injections were done with Nanoliter injector (World Precision Instruments), 400 nl per area, both at 0.3 nl/sec speed. PPC was injected with pseudotyped AAV virus containing red fluorescence (PAAV-CAG-tdTomato), and ACC was injected with pseudotyped AAV virus containing green fluorescence (PAAV-CAG-tdTomato). Neurons projecting to PPC were expected to show red signals, and neurons projecting to ACC were expected to show green signals, while neurons projecting to both areas would be observed in yellow. After the injections the incision was close by suturing, and mice were sacrificed after 2 weeks for histology. 

Histology
Dual retrograde tracing mice were sacrificed after 2 weeks of virus incubation. The mice were anesthesized deeply with isoflurane and perfused with 1X PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were extracted from the skull and left for postfixation in 4% PFA either for 1 hour in room temperature (RT) or overnight in 4C. After fixation, brain samples were transferred into 30% sucrose in RT on a shaker for 2-3 days. After the brains sunk to the bottom of the tube, they were embedded into optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium (Tissue Tek) and stored at -80C freezer. Cryosectioning was performed at 30 nm thickness at the cryostat (Leica), from posterior areas to PPC to anterior areas to ACC, collecting one section and discarding the next. Sections were collected on microscope slides, washed in 1X PBS 3 times for 10 minutes each, and mounted in DAPI. Slides were imaged at the scanning microscope, in the channels DAPI, EGFP, and TdTomato.
Behavioural experiment

Surgery
P40-60 mice were fixed at the stereotaxic device and kept at the same conditions as mentioned in the Dual Retrograde Tracing surgery. The scalp skin was cut and removed from between the eyes to the ears to expose the skull. Neck muscles were cut and removed. Skull was cleaned and PPC and ACC were marked. Headplates were attached to the skull with Loctite and dental cement. 

Head-fixed training
Head-fixed training was performed to later test the mice in multisensory decision making. Training was done in soundproof chambers, fixed in a head-fixed tube apparatus. The mice were set in licking distance from a water port, a 7 inch gamma-corrected LCD monitor 10 cm away from the left eye (minimum & maximum luminance set as 1 & 120Lux), and a speaker 10 cm away from the left ear. In an attempt to provide a sound proof environment, the wooden chambers were covered with insulating foam on the inside. The mice were trained in a Go/No-Go task for auditory and visual modalities simultaneously. Black and white gradient horizontal/vertical drifting gratings were used for visual stimuli. 5 kHz and 10 kHz pure tones were used for auditory stimuli. Vertical left-to-right drifting gratings and 5 kHz pure tone were trained as Go stimuli and horizontal bottom-to-top drifting gratings and 10 kHz pure tone were trained as No-Go stimuli. The animals were water deprived for 2 days before the training. The first days were free-water period, where the mouse would get 4ul water reward with every lick, with no stimuli present. When the lick rate reached 200 licks/20 min, the mouse was advanced to conditioning period. In this period the mouse was given 1 ul water reward for Go trials regardless of lick response for the association of the stimuli to the reward. No punishment was present at this stage. When the Hit Rate ((Hit x 100)/(Hit+Miss)) reached 70%, the animal would be moved onto the training period. Training period consisted of hit, miss, false alarm and correct rejection according to the mouse’s licking the lick port within the response window after stimulus presentation. Hit trials were rewarded with 1 ul of water if mice licked within the response window. False Alarm trials were punished with a 200 ms airpuff. Miss and Correct rejection trials were neither rewarded nor punished. If animals did not get 1 ml water in total from training in a day, it was given the amount of water to complete the consumption to 1 ml after the training. The training was regarded complete when the Correct Rate (((Hit+Correct Rejection) x 100)/Number of Trials)) reached 80%. In the case of one modality reaching the treshold faster, the mouse was trained in single modality until they were on the same level.

There are no standard rules
Rules for writing numbers vary greatly
Ex) Use words for numbers between one and one hundred. (numerals)
      Use words for numbers between one and nine. (as words)
Check a template or style guide for clarity
Consistency is key.
Numerous exceptions to these rules exist.

Figure numbers: Figure 2
Negative numbers: -1
Decimals: 0.3
Specific measurements: 12 meters/seconds
Percentages: 15 percent or 15 %
Monetary figures: $4,350
Large numbers: 46 million (Approximate, estimation)

Try to avoid starting sentences with numerals (Another sentence that comes right before the numerals may confuse decimal points and period or It is hard to pick out where the previous sentence ended and new sentence started. & It makes that starting sentence do not write in capital word )
ex) 64.1 milligrams of copper corroded during the test. -> Restructure to : During the tests, 64.1 milligrams of copper corroded.

If you write one number as a numeral, do it for all numbers of the same type. (Consistency)
ex) The snail advanced one inch. 
The snail advanced 1 inch on the first day and 12 inches on the second day.
The five researchers noted that the snail advanced 1 inch on the first day and 12 inches on the second day.(number of researchers do not have to match to the inches that the snail travels.)
		Five researchers: different type

With two numbers next to each other, write one out and use numerals for the other.
For example: We tested 52 twelve-inch snails Or We tested fifty-two 12-inch snails.
→ make clear! Avoid making complicated","Yes, I recall covering how to write with numbers in our class this week. I understand that there are no standard rules, but rather there are different rules that can vary widely. For instance, it is recommended to use numerals for numbers greater than nine, but spell out numbers between one and nine. It is important to check a template, style guide, or relevant journal for specific style requirements. Having consistency in writing is key. There are many exceptions to these rules, and for specific cases such as page numbers (page 2), figure numbers (Figure 2), negative numbers (-1), decimals (0.3), specific measurements (12 meters/seconds), percentages (15 percent or 15%), and monetary figures ($4,350) there may be unique guidance. It is also recommended to avoid starting sentences with numerals, and if one number is presented as a numeral, it is best to represent all others in the same way (keep consistency). Furthermore, when two numbers are next to each other, it is suggested to write one out and use a numeral for the other. Good job summarizing what you learned about how to write with numbers. Do you have any questions you would like to ask or points to clarify?",4,Other,"In the previous years, a trend of students enrolled in undergraduate or higher degrees moving farther away for education has been observed. Although having a bigger radius for university selection increases the number of opportunities, students who have close relationships with their families may experience homesickness. Paying frequent visits to the family may alleviate this issue. Furthermore, visiting their family for students often ends up with the benefit of receiving more supplies such as homemade food. We have hypothesized that students who visit their family more often are on average happier, and conducted a survey consisting of four questions.
Before finding a relationship between the frequency of visiting family and happiness, we needed to check some factors which can affect the frequency. To this end, we first asked people about the distance they live from their families. Among our 16 respondents, the most frequent visitor was the person who lived the closest to their family (0-50km) with 16 visits on average within 4 months, while people living farther than 300km away showed the lowest results with two no visits and one 1 visit (Figure 1). However, between 100-200km, no significant trend was observed. We then questioned whether the closeness of the relationship between the respondents and their families affected the number of visits. As can be seen in Figure 1, no correlation was observed. Three people reported their closeness to their family as a 7 on a scale of 0 to 10. While one of them visited 16 times in the given period, the other two remained at the low numbers of 1 and 2. This could be attributed to the distance factor, as the respondent visiting their family 16 times lives the closest to their home at 0-50km; however, two people living in the same distance interval (100-200km) reported their closeness level as 8 and visited home 8 and 1 times. Overall, it can be observed in Figure 1 that at the closest and farthest ends of the scale (0-50km & 300km) distance plays a significant role in the frequency of home visits, while it shows variety in the middle range (100-200km). Emotional closeness, on the other hand, does not seem to factor into the results. 

Lastly, we compared the frequency of visiting family with perceived level of happiness to test our hypothesis (Figure 2). No correlation was observed between the two factors. While respondent 1 with an average of 16 home visits in 4 months reported 4 on their level of happiness, respondent 15 scored the highest score, 10, on the happiness chart and did not visit their family at all. However, no inverse correlation was observed, as respondents with high responses on both questions (see respondent 3) and low responses on both questions (see respondent 7) were also present. Overall, our data has shown that there is no direct correlation between students’ level of happiness and their amount of home visits.","In the previous years, a trend of students enrolled in undergraduate or higher degrees moving farther away for education has been observed.

428,20230092-AW-1-1-04,AW,20230092,1,1,4,i am trying to explain why government should help people only in need.,"All right, here's a revised version of your sentence: ""If the government gave aid to every citizen, they would not be able to help everyone sufficiently. To provide assistance requires the recipients to also play their part by being in genuine need of help, as helping individuals who don't require assistance would detract from the aid provided to those who genuinely do need it."" 

This revised version makes it clearer that it is important for the government to assist those in need, rather than providing help to everyone. It also shows how offering help to those who do not require it would take away resources from those who do. Is there anything else you need help with?",5,Answer,"I think the government should help only in need. It’s because people who don’t need help is OK without help. However, government help is critical for people who need help. Also if the government give aids to every citizen government won’t be able to help sufficiently for neither to help requires the citizen nor the help non-required citizen.
First, I think the government should provide sufficient help for people who need help because government help is critical for their lives. For example, if a poor man with no family got an accident and need money for the surgery nobody else could borrow him money except for the government. As shown in the example since the government has a permission to help every citizen to live a healthy and pleasure life. Helping only people in need would be a key to maintain the whole citizen live better lives.
Second helping for every citizen will make help for each person too small since the government has limited money and material. Perhaps nobody will be satisfied after getting such a small help. some might think it’s unfair to have only some people not everybody it is still the best choice to keep most people well as possible. 
These are some reasons I think the government should help some people in need. By helping only people in need the government can use limited facility efficiently and people who need help we can get much more help than helping everyone in the society.

First, I think the government should provide sufficient help for people who need help because government help is critical for their lives. For example, if a poor man with no family got an accident and need money for the surgery nobody else could borrow him money except for the government. As shown in the example since the government has a permission to help every citizen to live a healthy and pleasure life. Helping only people in need would be a key to maintain the whole citizen live better lives.
Second helping for every citizen will make help for each person too small since the government has limited money and material. Perhaps nobody will be satisfied after getting such a small help. some might think it’s unfair to have only some people not everybody it is still the best choice to keep most people well as possible. 
These are some reasons I think the government should help some people in need. By helping only people in need the government can use limited facility efficiently and people who need help we can get much more help than helping everyone in the society.

","Thank you for providing your essay. Let's work through it together to make some improvements. 

First, let's work on the thesis statement. A thesis statement should clearly convey the essay’s main idea or argument. I would suggest revising your thesis statement to something like this: The government should only provide assistance to those in need because it ensures the government uses the limited resources efficiently and provides sufficient help for those who genuinely require it.

Next, let's remove the first sentence of the first paragraph: ""I think the government should help only in need."" Instead, you can start the paragraph by stating the main idea that you would like to discuss. For example: Government help is critical for individuals who require it.

In the second sentence of the first paragraph, you can reword the statement to have a more formal tone. For example: ""If assistance were to be given to every citizen, the government would be unable to provide sufficient help to those in genuine need.""

In the first sentence of the second paragraph, you can start by using a transition word such as ""Firstly"" to signal to the reader that you are introducing the first point. However, you should reword the sentence to have a more formal tone. For example, you can say: ""The government should provide sufficient aid to those who require it because it is critical for their well-being.""

In the second sentence of the second paragraph, you give an example to illustrate your point. However, the example could be clearer. You should refer to a real-life example that more accurately illustrates the point you are making. You could consider reworking this sentence to something like this: ""For instance, in the event that an individual who lacks financial resources and does not have anyone to turn to experiences a medical emergency, government aid would be their only option.""

The third paragraph doesn't have any major grammar or spelling issues, but it could be clearer. You should start by introducing the second point with a transition word such as ""Secondly."" Also, by using terms like ""some might think"" and ""perhaps,"" you weaken your argument. Instead, you should make a stronger statement that clearly states your opinion. For example: ""Assistance for every citizen would result in people receiving insignificant amounts of help that would fail to meet their needs.""

Lastly, in the conclusion, you should summarize your main points without introducing any new information. You can also restate your thesis statement to bring the essay to a satisfying close.

I hope these suggestions and feedback are helpful in revising your essay. Please let me know if you have any other questions.",5,ACK,"I think the government should help only in need.

The Mugungwha train is a conventional train that runs on a slower and more local route than the KTX. It is a cost-effective option for those who are looking to travel between cities and towns within the country. The train is popular among locals and budget-conscious travelers as it is cheaper than the KTX.

Moreover, the KTX is punctual and reliable, making it an attractive option for business travelers and tourists who want to maximize their time in Korea.

Another difference between the Mugungwha and the KTX is the availability of routes. The Mugungwha train runs on more local routes, connecting small towns and cities. The KTX, on the other hand, runs on a limited number of routes, mainly connecting major cities.

Can you check a grammer error about comma rules, adjectives, and adverbs?","Sure, let's take a look at the grammar in your essay. 

- In the second sentence, you have a list of actions and should use commas to separate them. It should read: ""When other usual universities select a major before they come to university, and keep on track of it, we choose a major in the second year.""

- In the fourth sentence, ""score"" should be ""scores,"" since the university is taking into account all of a student's high school work. It should read: ""Since the university makes scores of students' high school work, it's so important for students that they are afraid of changing their major area in the second or third year of high school.""

- In the fifth sentence, ""guess"" should be ""decision"" to more accurately convey the idea. It should read: ""How could a person make a decision of what to do in their whole life, only at the age of 17?""

- In the sixth sentence, ""largely"" should be ""broadly,"" which better fits the context. It should read: ""So 'the first year of college being major-free' can help students to have a time wondering what they will be in the future and experience many things as adults.""

- In the ninth sentence, ""campous"" should be ""campus."" It should read: ""Many people dream about campus life.""

- In the eleventh sentence, ""algorithm"" is misspelled as ""argorithum."" It should read: ""...many major areas share the same topics, like AI or algorithm.""

Regarding the use of adjectives and adverbs, you might consider adding more detail to your writing. For example, you could describe a ""hard time"" studying in high school as being ""stressful"" or ""hectic."" You could also consider using adverbs to explain how certain verbs are performed. For instance, you could use an adverb to describe how students ""work"" for three years, such as ""diligently"" or ""steadfastly.""

Lastly, let's check your concluding sentence. Does it summarize the paragraph and provide a transition to the next paragraph? If not, let's revise it accordingly. 

Remember, as you revise your essay, it is important to keep in mind the basic paragraph structure we discussed in class and ensure your ideas flow logically from one paragraph to the next.

When other usual universities select a major before they come to university, and keep on trach of it, we choose major in second year. This policy makes a lot of benefits to students and university.
 First, students can have a extra time to think about their dream. Since the university make scores of students' high school work, it's so important for students that they are afraid of changing their major area in the second or third year of high school. Instead, they choose the major in first grade of school and continuously diligently work on it for three years, only for the college. How could a person make a decision of what to do in their whole life, only in the age of 17? In the effect of policy about education in Korea, students don't have enough time to experience largely, and widely. So 'the first year of college being major-free' can help students to have a time wondering what they will be in the future and experience many things as adults. It could seen as wasting time (for 1 years) to study on their dream and major, but it could also seen as saving the time, because changing a major at the end of college Iwould take a time more than a year.
 Second, students can take a break after a stressful time studying in high school for three years. Even though some students totally made a decision about major before college, it would be not a bad sounds to hear. Many people dream about campus life. Everyone knew that university is a place where we study about deeper knowledge of many things, but having a good time with college friends from the world (or just ofther city) can helpful to students. Not only taking a break, but also meeting much more people than school can improve their wideth and depth of thoughts and creativity.
 Third, as the time goes, many major areas share a same topic, like AI or argorithm.

<essay>In our university, KAIST, we are major-free in the first year. Unlike other universities, where students select their majors before starting college and continue to study it, we choose a major in the second year. This policy has several benefits for both students and university. The reason for this is because of various causes and effects.
Firstly, being major-free in the first year allows students to have extra time to make decisions about their future. High school grades are very important when it comes to selecting majors, which puts a lot of pressure on students. Often, students choose their major solely based on their high school performance, which might not be a reliable indicator of interests or strengths. Choosing a major at the early age of 17 is difficult, and it is important to provide students with enough time to explore their options. Therefore, being major-free in the first year can provide students with time to experience different things as adults and have time to think about their dreams. This can help prevent students from feeling rushed to make such important decisions.
Secondly, students can benefit from a break after a demanding high school experience that had lasted for three years. Even if students have already decided on their major, taking time to meet people from all over the world and spend time with new friends can be beneficial. This time can help students to learn new perspectives, increase creativity, and improve their worldview. So, students can benefit by taking a break and having the freedom to explore college life without the constraints of a specific major.
Furthermore, over time, many subjects within different majors have started overlapping, especially with the rise of artificial intelligence. Giving students the opportunity to explore various subjects can improve their understanding of the shared topics, which improves their perspective on their major. Since many majors share similar course requirements like mathematics and physics, there would be no concern about wasting time on unrelated courses. Thus, students can benefit from a well-rounded education.
Lastly, colleges can worry less about enrolling students for different majors, as not all majors are equally popular. By allowing students to change their major as they wish, colleges do not have to worry about involuntary enrolment in less popular majors or over-enrolling in popular ones. Instead, they can focus solely on ensuring that enrolled students are studying and meeting their academic obligations. As a result, the university can benefit from a more flexible system that can adapt to the needs of students without the burden of bureaucratic obstacles.
Overall, being major-free in the first year of university can provide many benefits for both students and universities. Through the use of cause and effect paragraphs, we can better understand how this policy can benefit society as a whole.</essay>","Great start! Here are some suggestions to help you further organize and improve your essay based on what we've learned about complex sentences:

1. Incorporate complex sentences to show relationships between ideas.

You have included several examples of cause and effect relationships, which can be expressed more effectively using dependent clauses. Here's an example:

Before: <sent>""Choosing a major at the early age of 17 is difficult, and it is important to provide students with enough time to explore their options.""</sent>

After: <sent>""Since choosing a major at the early age of 17 is difficult, it is important to provide students with enough time to explore their options.""</sent>

By starting the sentence with a subordinating conjunction, you can clearly show the cause and effect relationship between the two ideas.

2. Vary your sentence structure.

To keep your essay engaging and avoid repetition, you can vary your sentence structures. Here's an example:

Before: <sent>""Even if students have already decided on their major, taking time to meet people from all over the world and spend time with new friends can be beneficial.""</sent>

After: <sent>""Despite having already decided on their major, students can benefit from taking time to meet people from all over the world and spend time with new friends.""</sent>

In this revised sentence, we've used the dependent clause ""despite having already decided on their major"" to show a contrasting idea, which adds variation to your essay.

3. Use transitions to show connections between paragraphs.

Transitions help guide the reader through your essay and show the connections between ideas. Here's an example:

Before:

Furthermore, over time, many subjects within different majors have started overlapping, especially with the rise of artificial intelligence. Giving students the opportunity to explore various subjects can improve their understanding of the shared topics, which improves their perspective on their major.

After:

Furthermore, over time, many subjects within different majors have started overlapping, especially with the rise of artificial intelligence. As a result, giving students the opportunity to explore various subjects can improve their understanding of the shared topics and, in turn, improve their perspective on their major. 

By starting the second paragraph with ""as a result,"" we can clearly show how the two ideas are connected.

expressed in a topic sentence. All sentences and details focus on supporting that one main idea. Everything should be connected, and it is unity. Unity helps the reader follow the writer's ideas. The reader expects each paragraph to have one main idea. When both the writer and reader follow this agreement, both writing and reading become a lot easier. And coherence is how well ideas are connected within a paragraph. Coherence is a logical bridge between words and sentences in essays. Sentences need to be ordered in a logical way with clear transitions.","Great! Now that you have a good understanding of unity and coherence, let's take a look at your essay and see how we can improve it.

First, let's focus on unity. Can you identify the main idea of each paragraph in your essay? If not, go through each paragraph and write down the main idea in one sentence. 

Once you have identified the main idea of each paragraph, make sure that all the sentences in that paragraph support that main idea. If there are any sentences that do not support the main idea, consider removing them or rephrasing them to better fit the paragraph's focus.

Next, let's work on coherence. Look at the order of your sentences within each paragraph. Are they in a logical order? Do they flow smoothly from one sentence to the next? If not, consider rearranging the sentences or adding transition words to help connect them.

Finally, make sure that there are clear transitions between each paragraph. This will help the reader follow your ideas and understand how they are connected. Consider using transition words or phrases such as ""in addition,"" ""however,"" or ""therefore"" to help connect your paragraphs.

Remember, the goal is to have each paragraph focus on one main idea and to have all the sentences within that paragraph support that main idea. Additionally, the sentences should be ordered in a logical way with clear transitions between paragraphs.

They use these internet technology devices to write down what they learn in class, download professor's lecture notes, and search something that they do not know exactly. There are two big advantages of using a tablet or a laptop computer in class.
The first advantage is that students can participate in class well by using the devices. For example, playing Kahoot quiz about what students have learned increases understanding of the concept they have learned, and using QR codes to join some activity in class will rise interest of students. In addition, we are in the post-covid era, students and professor can contact online via Zoom of Google Meets, and it can also increase participation of students in class who are far away. By using tablets and laptops, students can participate in class more actively.
The second advantage is the usefulness of using such devices. In class, professor do their class using lecture notes and sometimes they write down some letters on the white board. Students who use tablets or laptops can easily download the lecture note, write what they understand down on it, take some pictures of the white board and share some copy of their online notes. Also, by using some internet platforms such as KLMS or Google Classroom, students can upload their homework or handout more comfortably. The most important part of the advantages, usefulness, is that students can do those things with only one electronic device, they need no paper, no pencil, no erasers.

Now let's take a closer look at the punctuation and revise the content to make it stand out.

2. In the second sentence, use <sent>""These internet technology devices""<sent> instead of <sent>""these internet technology devices""</sent> to make it more specific. ""They"" is unclear, so instead of saying ""they use these internet technology devices to write down what they learn,"" say ""Students use these internet technology devices to take notes in class.""

3. In the third sentence, add a comma after ""For example"" to separate this introductory phrase from the main clause. 

4. In the fourth sentence, use ""the post-Covid era"" instead of ""the post-covid era"" and use ""Zoom or Google Meet"" instead of ""Zoom of Google Meets."" Also, in this sentence, add a comma after the word ""era"" to connect the dependent clause better to the independent clause.

It looks like you have discussed the two big advantages of using tablets or laptops in the class. However, there are some areas that need improvement, specifically related to coherence in the cause-and-effect relationships.

Here are some suggestions for revision:

1. Introduction: In the introduction, it is important to clearly state the cause-and-effect relationship. You could revise it to something like: <sent>""In recent years, the increased use of tablets, laptops, and other internet technology devices in classrooms has brought about two significant advantages: increased student participation and greater usefulness of these devices in the classroom.""</sent>

2. Topic Sentences:Each body paragraph needs a clear topic sentence which establishes the main point and the cause-and-effect relationship. For example, in your first body paragraph, your topic sentence could be revised to: <sent>""The use of tablets and laptops can lead to increased student participation in class activities by providing engaging tools and incorporating online learning platforms such as Kahoot quizzes and QR codes.""</sent>

3. Evidence and Analysis: You could develop the paragraph by including specific examples and analysis that support your main point. For example, you could provide a specific example of how Kahoot quizzes have increased understanding or how QR codes increase interest in an activity.

4. Linking the Cause-and-Effect Ideas: You can make the cause-and-effect ideas more coherent and connected by using appropriate transition words such as ""as a result,"" ""therefore,"" ""consequently,"" ""since,"" etc. 

5. Conclusion: Your conclusion could be revised to summarize the two advantages of using tablets and laptops in class and restate the main point of your essay.

First, we can add some cause and effect transition signals to make the relationship between the advantages and the devices more clear. I suggest you start the second paragraph with ""As a result"" to emphasize the cause and effect relationship between the use of tablets and increased student participation.

Next, let's work on incorporating semicolons to clarify the information in the essay. A semicolon can be used to separate two independent clauses that are closely related and could be separate sentences. 

For example, instead of saying ""In addition, we are in the post-covid era, students and professor can contact online via Zoom of Google Meets, and it can also increase participation of students in class who are far away,"" you can use a semicolon to connect the related ideas, like this: ""In addition, we are in the post-covid era; students and professors can contact each other online via Zoom or Google Meets, which can also increase participation of students who are far away."" 

Another way to use a semicolon would be in the sentence ""The most important part of the advantages, usefulness, is that students can do those things with only one electronic device; they need no paper, no pencil, no erasers."" Here, the semicolon is used to emphasize the importance of the advantages of using electronic devices in the classroom and to clarify the information.

Additionally, let's make sure the verb tense is consistent throughout the essay. For example, in the second sentence of the first paragraph, you wrote ""has brought about,"" which is in present perfect tense. However, the following sentence uses present tense. Be consistent in your use of verb tense to ensure clarity and coherence.

Finally, we can add some transition signals between the paragraphs to make the flow of information more smooth. For example, you could use phrases like ""Moreover"" or ""Furthermore"" to connect the two paragraphs.

Here's a revision of your essay with these suggested improvements:

On one hand, the use of tablets and laptops can increase student participation in activities by providing engaging tools and incorporating online learning platforms. For instance, playing Kahoot or Quizlet games enhances understanding and retention of key concepts. Similarly, online platforms like Zoom or Google Meets offer students the opportunity to engage with professors and peers, regardless of their physical location.

On the opposite end, some critics argue that a dependence on electronic devices in the classroom has adverse effects, such as fostering a culture of distraction that undermines students' ability to focus. Additionally, technology can sometimes fail, leading to disruptions in teaching and learning. Furthermore, while electronic documents are convenient, they can be easily lost if not properly saved or backed up.
However, the benefits of using electronic devices in the classroom outweigh the disadvantages. In particular, these devices enable greater collaboration, productivity, and flexibility among students and professors. By taking advantage of these benefits, students can use their own tablet or laptop computers in class with more ease and productivity.

Once you've located a pronoun, look for the noun it refers to. If you can't find a clear noun, try to rephrase the sentence so that the antecedent is more specific.

3. Use a clear noun instead of the pronoun
Once you've identified the antecedent, replace the pronoun with a clear and specific noun. Using a noun, instead of a pronoun, will minimize any confusion and enhance the clarity of your writing.

To sum up, it is important to talk first, be polite, and make a smile to friend.</essay>

check this out plz","Sure, here are the grammatical errors I found in your essay and instructions on how to correct them:

1. Use ""make"" or ""taking"" before ""first"" to signify you ""take the initiative"" to start a conversation with a friend.
 
Correction: ""First, taking the initiative is important. To start a conversation and become closer, it is necessary to talk first to others.""

2. The sentence ""Make the word before the friend talks"" is unclear. Perhaps you meant to say ""Speak before the friend talks""?

Correction: ""Speak first before your friend does. That way, your friend will have less burden to talk first when you meet later.""

3. The grammar in the sentence ""If a speaker talks politely, the listener will also try to be so"" is incorrect. It should be ""If a speaker speaks politely, the listener will also try to do so.""

Correction: ""Next, be polite when speaking to others. If you speak politely, the listener will also try to do so. Polite conversation will make friends feel closer to you because they know you are actively paying attention to their words.""

4. Use ""always smile"" instead of ""always make smile"", as ""make"" implies creating something, while ""smile"" is a verb that communicates a state of being.

Correction: ""Finally, always smile. A smile makes you look more friendly and kind. Additionally, others will likely respond positively to your smile, which will create a happier conversation. In summary, it is important to take the initiative, be polite when speaking, and always smile around friends.""

First-year undergraduates at KAIST do not have a specific major. Many other universities have majors that do not require a specific major in the first year, and some universities even allow undergraduates to be free of a major until graduation. For this reason, universities should require the first year of college to be major-free. There are three primary benefits to having a major-free first year of college.

First, a year without a major gives students more freedom to choose and enables them to live a less passive life. Students can select what their lives and their first year of college will be like. A computer science student from the first year might not try to explore other interests and might blindly accept that computer science is their predetermined future, instead of discovering their true passion. On the other hand, freshmen without a major can make informed and thoughtful decisions about their future. Though students may face a painstaking process in making decisions, the act of actively choosing one's life path will help them build identity and motivation. The same student will choose challenging schedules by attending lots of classes, while others can attend diverse classes in various majors.

Secondly, by being major-free, freshmen can create networks with people of diverse interests, which can lead to breakthroughs not just in academic areas but also in arts and business. Major-free freshmen will easily make bonds with people with diverse interests and history. Students with a specific major would not try to explore their interests, challenge themselves, or gain exposure to different subjects as much as freshmen without a major would.

Lastly, it's hard to become interested in a specific major until high school graduation. Lacking life experience, high school students often choose majors at first glance or without knowing what the major entails. Universities in South Korea grade high school students by their 'major-compatible rate,' which cause high school students to lie about their interests on school records.

First, when government helps all of its citizens,  ore people who are in need will be neglected. Second, people who are very wealthy don't need any help from the government.","Great, let's start revising your essay with parallelism! 

First, let's look at your thesis statement. It is clear, but we can make it more parallel to emphasize your main points. One way to do this is to use a ""not only, but also"" structure. You can say ""Not only should the government help those most in need, but it should also avoid providing aid to those who are wealthy."" This structure helps to show the contrast between the two sides of your argument, and also creates a parallel sentence structure. 

Next, let's look at your body paragraphs. You mentioned two reasons for your opinion, so we can make those more parallel as well. For example:

- First, by focusing aid on those most in need, the government can ensure that resources are not wasted on those who do not require it. This targeted approach can provide greater support for those struggling to make ends meet.
- Second, providing aid to the wealthy creates a disparity in the distribution of resources. The government has a responsibility to prioritize the needs of its most vulnerable citizens, rather than providing unnecessary aid to those who already have the means to support themselves.  

In both of these statements, we used similar sentence structures and parallel phrasing to make the argument clearer and more cohesive. 

Now let's move on to your conclusion. You can use parallel structure here as well to summarize your main points. For example:

- In conclusion, the government should focus its aid on those who are most in need, rather than attempting to provide assistance to all citizens. By doing so, we can ensure that resources are distributed more fairly, and that those who require the most support receive it. 

Here, we used similar phrasing to the thesis statement at the beginning of the essay, which creates a sense of closure and reinforces your argument.

Your essay is well-structured and presents a clear argument. However, there are a few areas where you can improve. Let's go through each section of your essay and make the necessary revisions.

Introduction:
Your introduction is good, but it could be stronger. You should provide a bit more context and background information to help the reader understand the issue you are discussing. Additionally, your thesis statement could be more specific. Here's a revised introduction:

The issue of government assistance is a contentious one, with many people arguing that the government should help all citizens, while others believe that resources should be focused on those who are most in need. In this essay, I will argue that the government should prioritize helping the most vulnerable members of society. By doing so, we can create a more equitable society that benefits everyone.

Body:
Your body paragraphs are well-organized and present strong arguments. However, you could provide more evidence to support your claims. Additionally, you should address potential counterarguments to strengthen your position. Here are some revisions to your body paragraphs:

Paragraph 1:
Firstly, it is important to recognize that there are many vulnerable members of society who require government assistance. For example, elderly citizens who live alone in poverty often struggle to make ends meet and require support to maintain a decent standard of living. However, if the government tries to help everyone, it is inevitable that some of these individuals will be overlooked. This is because resources are limited, and it is difficult to provide comprehensive support to everyone. Therefore, it is essential that the government focuses its efforts on supporting the most disadvantaged members of society.

Paragraph 2:
Secondly, it is unfair for wealthy individuals to receive government benefits when they don't need them. While some argue that everyone should receive equal treatment, this ignores the fact that some people have more resources than others. In order to create a more equitable society, it is important that those who have an abundance of resources contribute more to social welfare initiatives. This can be achieved through higher taxes and other measures that ensure that the burden of supporting those in need is shared more equitably.

Conclusion:
Your conclusion is good, but it could be more impactful. You should restate your thesis statement and summarize your main arguments. Additionally, you could provide a call to action to encourage the reader to take action. Here's a revised conclusion:

In conclusion, the government should prioritize helping the most vulnerable members of society. By doing so, we can create a more equitable society that benefits everyone. This can be achieved through targeted support for those in need, as well as measures that ensure that the burden of supporting those in need is shared more equitably.

2. In the second paragraph, you need a comma after ""thus"" in the sentence ""Thus, they do not have time to search their dream or major.""

3. In the third paragraph, you need a comma after ""When"" in the sentence ""When we choose the major, we have to choose the course related to our major.""

4. In the last sentence of the third paragraph, you need a comma after ""violent"" to separate two adjectives.

5. In the last paragraph, you need a comma after ""Thus"" in the sentence ""Thus, for more experiences, the first year in college should be major-free.""

Now that we've identified the areas where you need commas, let's work on correcting them. Do you have any questions about comma usage or how to apply the corrections to your essay?",5,ACK,"The universities should be major free in first year of college. These days in Korea, lots of smart students who are in high scored universities like Seoul, Yonsei, or Kaist, leave their schools. It could be due to universities’ system that they should choose their major before they enter to universities. Instead of this, there are lots of problems in choosing major early. Thus, universities should be required to major-free in first year of college.
At first, in high school, it is hard to choose the major. In universities, there are many major and classes. However, in high school, every students learn just few subjects like chemistry and physics. Also, they cannot get the information of major easily. Thus, there are less information of major, so students cannot choose major well. Un addition they do not have much time to think about major. Korea’s national exam ‘수능’ is very hard and it is hard to get good grade. Due to this, high school students have to study very hard than others. Thus, they do not have time to search their dream or major. In conclusion, high school students do not have sufficient information and time to choose major, so first grade of college should be major free. 
Second, the major-free year could be provide diverse experience to students. When we choose the major, we have to choose the course related to our major, so undergraduate student’s background information could be limited. Especially, these days, the collaboration of diverse major is important. It could be help people to be more creative and think diverse way. Thus, for more experiences, the first year in college should be major free.
At next, the major-free policy could help the Korea’s education system changing. The past and current education system is not helpful to students’ future. For example, in high school students study hard for ‘수능’. But when they finished the exam, they forgot lots of things and did not study them again. Thus, the three years of students in high school is not that efficiency. On the other hand, some students who want to be a biologist of chemist, study the Earth science or East Asian history, because these subjects are easy to them. It is not good education. When, every college change the first year to major-free, students do not have to study for get the good major. In addition, students choose the major that are highest they can get with their grade.

Like this, most of students in Korea, they cannot study what they want tin college. So, the first year in college should be major-free.

To check for run-on errors in your essay, first, you need to understand what a run-on sentence is. A run-on sentence occurs when two or more independent clauses are joined together without proper punctuation or coordinating conjunctions.

To assess your essay for run-on errors, I suggest reading it aloud and paying attention to places where you use multiple clauses or ideas that go on for an extended period. If it feels like you're saying too much in one breath, that could be a sign of a run-on sentence.

After you've identified a possible run-on sentence, check for correct punctuation and consider whether the clauses are independent of each other or whether they need to be separated or paired with appropriate coordinating conjunctions.

","The universities should be major free in first year of college. These days in Korea, lots of smart students who are in high scored universities like Seoul, Yonsei, or Kaist, leave their schools. It could be due to universities’ system that they should choose their major before they enter to universities. Instead of this, there are lots of problems in choosing major early. Thus, universities should be required to major-free in first year of college.
At first, in high school, it is hard to choose the major. In universities, there are many major and classes. However, in high school, every students learn just few subjects like chemistry and physics. Also, they cannot get the information of major easily. Thus, there are less information of major, so students cannot choose major well. Un addition they do not have much time to think about major. Korea’s national exam ‘수능’ is very hard and it is hard to get good grade. Due to this, high school students have to study very hard than others. Thus, they do not have time to search their dream or major. In conclusion, high school students do not have sufficient information and time to choose major, so first grade of college should be major free. 
Second, the major-free year could be provide diverse experience to students. When we choose the major, we have to choose the course related to our major, so undergraduate student’s background information could be limited. Especially, these days, the collaboration of diverse major is important. It could be help people to be more creative and think diverse way. Thus, for more experiences, the first year in college should be major free.
At next, the major-free policy could help the Korea’s education system changing. The past and current education system is not helpful to students’ future. For example, in high school students study hard for ‘수능’. But when they finished the exam, they forgot lots of things and did not study them again. Thus, the three years of students in high school is not that efficiency. On the other hand, some students who want to be a biologist of chemist, study the Earth science or East Asian history, because these subjects are easy to them. It is not good education. When, every college change the first year to major-free, students do not have to study for get the good major. In addition, students choose the major that are highest they can get with their grade. For example, in our school, student who want to be biologist go to mechanic school, and student who want to be a physicist go to medical school. Like this, most of students in Korea, they cannot study what they want tin college. So, the first year in college should be major-free.

491,20230625-AW-1-1-02,AW,20230625,1,1,2,"<essay>I think the government should help all of its citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background. 
Firstly, government is an organization for all people. Government is here for everyone. It is true that when the government help people in need, it will be able to help people as much as possible, which will be very helpful for them. However, the fact that helping people in need has many positive aspects does not meas that it is okay to ‘not help others’. Government only working for a small part of people and ignoring the rest should not happen. Also, I think it is unfair either. I agree to helping a bit more to the people in need. There are people who can’t live without some help of the government. There are problems that government should deal with in order to help people. However, only helping those who need help could be viewed as discriminating others. As I already wrote, government is an organization for all. Making nobody feel discriminated by the government is the way I think government should go. 
Secondly, in a realistic point of view, government could not exist only with those who are in need, so that they should take care of others. For example, government is managed by money that people pay as tax. To get much tax, they should have many people who are rich in the country. In order to keep them in the country, the country should do something for them. If the government only help those in need and ignore others, the government could not exist. Therefore, the best way to help those in need is not just helping them fully but helping them steady. 
These are the reasons why I think government should help all of its citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background.</essay>","Great! Let's start by addressing the choppy sentences. 

Firstly, your essay has several short sentences that could be combined. Here's an example: 

Original: <sent>Government is here for everyone. It is true that when the government help people in need, it will be able to help people as much as possible, which will be very helpful for them. </sent>

Revised: <sent>The government is here for everyone, and it's true that helping people in need will be helpful for them. </sent>

Notice how I combined the first two sentences using ""and"" and rephrased the second sentence to make it more concise. 

Next, your essay could use more complex sentence structures using subordination and coordination. Here's an example: 

Original: <sent>There are people who can’t live without some help of the government. There are problems that government should deal with in order to help people. However, only helping those who need help could be viewed as discriminating others. </sent>

Revised: <sent>For some people, government assistance is necessary to sustain their livelihood. While it is important to acknowledge the problems that the government should address, solely assisting those in need could be perceived as discriminatory towards others. </sent>

Notice how I combined the first two sentences using ""for"" and inserted ""while"" to make the second sentence dependent on the first. 

Finally, make sure to proofread your work for grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and typos. 

Keep these tips in mind as you revise your essay. Good luck!",5,ACK,"I think the government should help all of its citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background.

Others, only watching people getting help by the government but themsleves not getting any help, they will feel unfair.

It sounds like you've got a good handle on one of the most basic comma rules. Let's see if you can apply that rule to your essay. 

First, look through your essay and identify places where you have lists of two or more elements. Once you've found them, make sure that you have used commas to separate those elements. 

If you haven't used commas, add them in where necessary. For example:

Original: On my trip I visited Paris London and Rome.

Revised: On my trip, I visited Paris, London, and Rome.

If you have used commas, double-check that you've used them correctly. Remember that there should be a comma between each element in the list, and the final element should also be followed by a comma before the coordinating conjunction (e.g. and, or).

Once you're done with that step, look over your essay again to make sure that there are no places where you've used a comma incorrectly. For example:

Original: I went to the store, to get some milk.

Revised: I went to the store to get some milk.

In this case, the comma is unnecessary and should be removed.

 In Korea, most of the universities require the freshmen to choose their major before they start their first year. But very few of them including -IST universities like KAIST, let the first year students to be major-free. They choose their major in second year, or in the end of their first year. Even though there are many advantages and disadvantages with it, I think the first year students of college should be major-free.
 One of the most important benefit of first-year-major-free is that the freshmen can have chances to have contact with various fields of study. Some people may say major-free can make students stressed by forcing them to listen to unintersted subjects. But in the near future, we have to work on topics that are not only included to one field. We will need knowledges and perspectives of various fields, and the basic knowledge from the first year class will help overcoming it. Also, we can find unexpected interests. Learning about new fields of study may help them find their interests.
 Secondly, some other people say major-free is a waste of time for students who already decided their major, but it is not quite true. For example, despite my university is major-free in the first year, there are friends who listen to the classes for particular major. Some of them are accquiring organic, or biochemistry, and another friend is accquiring programming class for 3rd, or 4th years. Likewise, students with concrete dicision about their major can participate to such class, because it's major-'free'.
 Lastly, major-free can help first-year students meet diverse people. In most universities that require their first students to choose their major usually divides the dormitory or class by major. This prevents students to meet people from other major, who have different point of view. Major-free can make students team-up with students of other majors, and help them grow abilities to cooperate with people who think different from them.
 In conclusion, letting first-year students of college to be major-free can help them find new interests, freely listen to their intersted subjects, meet diverse people. For these reasons, I strongly believe making first-year students of universities will help the students and the society.","Advantages of making first year students be major-free

Some people may say being major-free can make students stressed by forcing them to listen to uninterested subjects. But in the near future, we will have to work on topics that are not only included in one field. We will need knowledge and perspectives from various fields, and the basic knowledge from the first year classes will help in overcoming it. Also, we can find unexpected interests. Learning about new fields of study may help students find their interests.

Secondly, some other people say being major-free is a waste of time for students who have already decided their major, but it is not quite true. For example, despite my university being major-free in the first year, there are friends who attend classes for a particular major. Some of them are acquiring knowledge about organic or biochemistry, and another friend is acquiring programming classes for 3rd or 4th years. Likewise, students with a concrete decision about their major can participate in such classes because they are major-free.

Lastly, being major-free can help first-year students meet diverse people. In most universities that require their freshmen to choose their major, they usually divide the dormitories or classes by major. This prevents students from meeting people from other majors, who have different points of view. Being major-free can make students team-up with students of other majors and help develop the ability to cooperate with people who think differently from them.

In conclusion, allowing first-year college students to be major-free can help them find new interests, freely listen to their interested subjects, and meet diverse people. For these reasons, I strongly believe that allowing first-year university students to be major-free will help both the students and society.",TRUE,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL
512,20230722-IRW-1-1-05,IRW,20230722,1,1,5,Thank you!,"Sure, I'd be happy to take a closer look at your grammar. Here are a few suggested revisions with explanations:

- In the first sentence, ""freshmen"" should be changed to ""first-year students"" to make the language more gender-neutral. 
- In the second sentence, ""major-free"" should be restructured to ""be major-free"" for clarity.
- In the third sentence, ""But very few of them, including -IST universities like KAIST,"" would be better as ""Except for a few universities that follow the model of KAIST, most require first-year students to declare a major before beginning their studies."" This sentence keeps the same idea while improving the flow and grammar of the statement. 
- In the seventh sentence, ""assigments"" should be changed to ""classes"" to more accurately describe the students' educational experience.
- In the ninth sentence, ""dormitory"" should be changed to ""dormitories"" to match the plural subject being discussed.
- In the final sentence, ""making first-year students of universities"" is unclear phrasing. Instead, try ""allowing first-year university students to be major-free"". This change results in clearer language that conveys the intended meaning more accurately. 

I hope these suggestions are helpful in improving your essay's grammar. Let me know if you have any questions!",5,ACK,"Advantages of making first year students be major-free

1. Check for parallelism: This is when you use similar grammatical structures, phrases, or words to create balance in your writing. Look for places in your essay where you can use parallel structure to improve the flow and emphasis of your writing.

2. Identify and correct sentence problems: There are a lot of potential sentence problems that you might encounter in writing, including run-on sentences, sentence fragments, and misplaced modifiers, among others. Make sure that you read through your essay carefully to identify any issues that might be holding back your writing.

With those points in mind, let's start with your essay.

	Why do you think the government takes places at the first place? It is to do things that individuals can’t by themselves. It is hard for normal people to find those who need help, and give help to them. Helping those in need is one of the best thing that the government can do.

If the government helps all the people, the gap between the rich and the poor will not be reduced, but be intensified. There fore, the rich will be easy to maintain life, and the poor should scrub along. However, if the government help those in need, they will have a base to develop, and that’s not making the society become fixed, but making it much more different and flexible in a good way.

Let's start with revising the essay focusing on parallel structure. As a teacher, I suggest you identify places in the essay where you could enhance parallel structure. Here are some examples:

1. In the first paragraph, you could revise <sent>""the government can do things that individuals can’t""</sent> and <sent>""it is hard for those in need to live well by their own.""</sent> for parallel structure. You could rewrite it as <sent>""the government can do things that individuals can’t, and it is hard for those in need to live well on their own.""</sent>

2. In the second paragraph, you could revise <sent>""money comes from money""</sent> for a parallel structure. You could rewrite it as <sent>""money makes money.""</sent>

3. In the third paragraph, you could revise <sent>""making the society much more different""</sent> for parallel structure. You could rewrite it as <sent>""making the society much more diverse.""</sent>

4. In the last paragraph, you could revise <sent>""the particular help of the government will make the whole society happy""</sent> for parallel structure. You could rewrite it as <sent>""the particular help of the government will make the whole society happier.""</sent>

Remember to use similar grammatical structures and phrases to create balance in your writing. Now, let's move on to the sentence problems.

Read through your essay carefully and identify any sentence problems. Here are a few common sentence problems to consider:

1. Run-on sentences: When two or more sentences are joined together without proper punctuation, it creates a run-on sentence. To fix this, you could either separate the sentences or use proper punctuation, such as a comma or semicolon.

2. Sentence Fragments: A sentence fragment is an incomplete sentence that is missing a subject or verb. To fix this, you could add a subject or verb to complete the sentence.

3. Misplaced Modifiers: A misplaced modifier can create confusion or change the meaning of a sentence. To fix this, you could place the modifier next to the word it modifies or revise the sentence structure to avoid the problem.

Keep these sentence problems in mind as you review your essay for clarity and coherence.

517,20230773-AW-4-1-02,AW,20230773,4,1,2,"<essay>Fast food is a type of food that is known for its quick preparation time and easy accessibility, while having lots of problems. The popularity of fast food has grown significantly since the 1950s when it was first introduced. Fast foods can be found in chain restaurants that sell only fast foods for sales. For well known chain restaurants, there are  McDonald’s, Lotteria, Burger King, and KFC.  Because these chain restaurants are in almost every place, the accessibility of fast foods are very good. However, while fast food is a convenient and affordable option for many people, it has been associated with several health problems that have many people in the society has, or has a risk of  getting those problems. In this essay, the reason why people prefer fast foods, and the effects of fast foods will be dealt with. 

One of the primary reasons for the popularity of fast food is its convenience. There are big 3 reasons why fast foods are convenient. First, fast food restaurants are typically located in busy areas or all over the world. So when people travel around the world and doesn’t have anything to eat, fast foods are one of the best choice. 

        Second, they are open for extended hours, when other restaurants are on a break time or are closed. For students or office workers that work last and are hungry, the only choice to fill one’s hunger. 

Lastly, when there is less time or inappropriate place to eat, fast food has a benefit. For people with busy schedules or who has a next schedule, like the word “fast food”, the cooking process and distribution process are so fast, so that it's good to fill up the energy quickly. Additionally, fast food is easy to eat while driving or walking, further contributing to its convenience factor.

The low cost of fast food is one of the primary reasons why it has become so popular among people of all ages and backgrounds. Why are fast foods cheap? There are several reasons. Fast food restaurants tend to have simple menus with limited options, which helps to reduce costs by minimizing the number of ingredients needed and simplifying the cooking process. They also tend to rely on pre-packaged and pre-portioned ingredients, which reduces waste and helps to keep costs down.

Also, fast food restaurants typically have lower overhead costs than sit-down restaurants. They often operate in high-traffic areas with lower rent costs, and they require less space for seating and dining areas. This allows them to focus on the food preparation and service, rather than on creating an elaborate dining experience.
For these these reasons, fast food restaurants offer a quick, convenient, and affordable option for people who are looking for a quick bite to eat without breaking the bank. While fast food has been associated with a range of health problems, there are also some benefits to its low cost.
One of the most significant benefits of the low cost of fast food is its affordability for people on a tight budget. For many people, fast food is the only viable option when it comes to eating out. Eating at a sit-down restaurant or purchasing groceries and preparing meals at home can be expensive, and not everyone has the resources or time to do so. In these cases, fast food can be a lifesaver, providing an affordable and convenient option for people who are on a tight budget.

However, while fast food is convenient and affordable, it has been linked to several health problems. One of the most significant health issues associated with fast food is obesity. Fast food is often high in calories, fat, and sugar, which can contribute to weight gain. Studies have shown that people who eat fast food regularly are more likely to be overweight or obese than those who do not. Moreover, fast food is often high in salt, which can lead to high blood pressure and other health problems.

Another health problem associated with fast food is diabetes. Fast food is often high in carbohydrates, which can cause blood sugar levels to spike. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. A diet high in fast food can also increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Fast food is also linked to heart disease. Fast food is often high in saturated and trans fats, which can increase cholesterol levels and lead to the buildup of plaque in the arteries. This can result in heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. In addition, fast food consumption has been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer.

Moreover, fast food has been linked to mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. This is thought to be due to the high levels of sugar and fat in fast food, which can affect mood and contribute to mental health problems. Fast food consumption has also been associated with poor academic performance in children and teenagers, potentially due to the negative effects of a poor diet on cognitive function.

Despite the negative effects of fast food, it remains a popular choice for many people. This may be due in part to the addictive qualities of fast food, which can make it difficult for people to resist. Additionally, fast food is often marketed to children and teenagers through targeted advertising and promotions, which can make it an appealing choice for young people.

Aside from health problems, fast food has other negative effects as well. For instance, it can harm the environment due to the generation of large amounts of waste, including packaging, food waste, and plastic utensils.

Keep up the good work!",4,ACK,"Fast food is a type of food that is known for its quick preparation time and easy accessibility, while having lots of problems. The popularity of fast food has grown significantly since the 1950s when it was first introduced. Fast foods can be found in chain restaurants that sell only fast foods for sales. For well known chain restaurants, there are  McDonald’s, Lotteria, Burger King, and KFC.  Because these chain restaurants are in almost every place, the accessibility of fast foods are very good. However, while fast food is a convenient and affordable option for many people, it has been associated with several health problems that have many people in the society has, or has a risk of  getting those problems. In this essay, the reason why people prefer fast foods, and the effects of fast foods will be dealt with. 

One of the primary reasons for the popularity of fast food is its convenience. There are big 3 reasons why fast foods are convenient. First, fast food restaurants are typically located in busy areas or all over the world. So when people travel around the world and doesn’t have anything to eat, fast foods are one of the best choice. 

        Second, they are open for extended hours, when other restaurants are on a break time or are closed. For students or office workers that work last and are hungry, the only choice to fill one’s hunger. 

Lastly, when there is less time or inappropriate place to eat, fast food has a benefit. For people with busy schedules or who has a next schedule, like the word “fast food”, the cooking process and distribution process are so fast, so that it's good to fill up the energy quickly. Additionally, fast food is easy to eat while driving or walking, further contributing to its convenience factor.

The low cost of fast food is one of the primary reasons why it has become so popular among people of all ages and backgrounds. Why are fast foods cheap? There are several reasons. Fast food restaurants tend to have simple menus with limited options, which helps to reduce costs by minimizing the number of ingredients needed and simplifying the cooking process. They also tend to rely on pre-packaged and pre-portioned ingredients, which reduces waste and helps to keep costs down.

Also, fast food restaurants typically have lower overhead costs than sit-down restaurants. They often operate in high-traffic areas with lower rent costs, and they require less space for seating and dining areas. This allows them to focus on the food preparation and service, rather than on creating an elaborate dining experience.
For these these reasons, fast food restaurants offer a quick, convenient, and affordable option for people who are looking for a quick bite to eat without breaking the bank. While fast food has been associated with a range of health problems, there are also some benefits to its low cost.
One of the most significant benefits of the low cost of fast food is its affordability for people on a tight budget. For many people, fast food is the only viable option when it comes to eating out. Eating at a sit-down restaurant or purchasing groceries and preparing meals at home can be expensive, and not everyone has the resources or time to do so. In these cases, fast food can be a lifesaver, providing an affordable and convenient option for people who are on a tight budget.

However, while fast food is convenient and affordable, it has been linked to several health problems. One of the most significant health issues associated with fast food is obesity. Fast food is often high in calories, fat, and sugar, which can contribute to weight gain. Studies have shown that people who eat fast food regularly are more likely to be overweight or obese than those who do not. Moreover, fast food is often high in salt, which can lead to high blood pressure and other health problems.

Another health problem associated with fast food is diabetes. Fast food is often high in carbohydrates, which can cause blood sugar levels to spike. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. A diet high in fast food can also increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Fast food is also linked to heart disease. Fast food is often high in saturated and trans fats, which can increase cholesterol levels and lead to the buildup of plaque in the arteries. This can result in heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. In addition, fast food consumption has been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer.

Moreover, fast food has been linked to mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. This is thought to be due to the high levels of sugar and fat in fast food, which can affect mood and contribute to mental health problems. Fast food consumption has also been associated with poor academic performance in children and teenagers, potentially due to the negative effects of a poor diet on cognitive function.

Despite the negative effects of fast food, it remains a popular choice for many people. This may be due in part to the addictive qualities of fast food, which can make it difficult for people to resist. Additionally, fast food is often marketed to children and teenagers through targeted advertising and promotions, which can make it an appealing choice for young people.

Aside from health problems, fast food has other negative effects as well. For instance, it can harm the environment due to the generation of large amounts of waste, including packaging, food waste, and plastic utensils. This waste contributes to pollution and can have adverse impacts on wildlife. Additionally, fast food chains can negatively impact local economies, as they can drive smaller, locally-owned restaurants out of business, leading to job losses and a decrease in economic activity in the local community.

For these these reasons, fast food restaurants offer a quick, convenient, and affordable option for people who are looking for a quick bite to eat without breaking the bank. While fast food has been associated with a range of health problems, there are also some benefits to its low cost.
One of the most significant benefits of the low cost of fast food is its affordability for people on a tight budget. For many people, fast food is the only viable option when it comes to eating out. Eating at a sit-down restaurant or purchasing groceries and preparing meals at home can be expensive, and not everyone has the resources or time to do so. In these cases, fast food can be a lifesaver, providing an affordable and convenient option for people who are on a tight budget.

However, while fast food is convenient and affordable, it has been linked to several health problems. One of the most significant health issues associated with fast food is obesity. Fast food is often high in calories, fat, and sugar, which can contribute to weight gain. Studies have shown that people who eat fast food regularly are more likely to be overweight or obese than those who do not. Moreover, fast food is often high in salt, which can lead to high blood pressure and other health problems.

Another health problem associated with fast food is diabetes. Fast food is often high in carbohydrates, which can cause blood sugar levels to spike. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. A diet high in fast food can also increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Fast food is also linked to heart disease. Fast food is often high in saturated and trans fats, which can increase cholesterol levels and lead to the buildup of plaque in the arteries. This can result in heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. In addition, fast food consumption has been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer.

Moreover, fast food has been linked to mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. This is thought to be due to the high levels of sugar and fat in fast food, which can affect mood and contribute to mental health problems. Fast food consumption has also been associated with poor academic performance in children and teenagers, potentially due to the negative effects of a poor diet on cognitive function.

Despite the negative effects of fast food, it remains a popular choice for many people. This may be due in part to the addictive qualities of fast food, which can make it difficult for people to resist. Additionally, fast food is often marketed to children and teenagers through targeted advertising and promotions, which can make it an appealing choice for young people.

Aside from health problems, fast food has other negative effects as well. For instance, it can harm the environment due to the generation of large amounts of waste, including packaging, food waste, and plastic utensils. This waste contributes to pollution and can have adverse impacts on wildlife. Additionally, fast food chains can negatively impact local economies, as they can drive smaller, locally-owned restaurants out of business, leading to job losses and a decrease in economic activity in the local community.

	Fast food, with its easy accessibility and affordability in both urban and rural areas, provides a quick source of energy. However, despite the convenience it offers, frequent consumption of fast food can lead to various negative impacts, most notably health issues. The high salt and fat content of fast food can contribute to a range of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and even mental health conditions such as depression.","Fast food is a type of food that is known for its quick preparation time and easy accessibility, though associated with various health risks. The popularity of fast food has grown significantly since the 1950s when it was first introduced. Fast foods can be found in chain restaurants that sell only fast foods for sales. For well-known chain restaurants, there are  McDonald’s, Lotteria, Burger King, and KFC.  Because these chain restaurants are in almost every place, the accessibility of fast foods are very good. However, while fast food is a convenient and affordable option for many people, it has been associated with several health problems that have many people in the society have, or have a risk of  getting those problems. In this essay, the reason why people prefer fast foods, and the effects of fast foods will be dealt with. 

One of the primary reasons for the popularity of fast food is its convenience. There are big 3 reasons why fast foods are convenient. First, fast food restaurants are typically located in busy areas or all over the world. So when people travel around the world and don’t have anything to eat, fast foods are one of the best choice. 

        Second, they are open for extended hours, when other restaurants are on a break time or are closed. For students or office workers that work last and are hungry, the only choice to fill one’s hunger. 

Lastly, when there is less time or inappropriate place to eat, fast food has a benefit. For people with busy schedules or who has a next schedule, like the word “fast food”, the cooking process and distribution process are so fast, so that it's good to fill up the energy quickly. Additionally, fast food is easy to eat while driving or walking, further contributing to its convenience factor.

The low cost of fast food is one of the primary reasons why it has become so popular among people of all ages and backgrounds. Why are fast foods cheap? There are several reasons. Fast food restaurants tend to have simple menus with limited options, which helps to reduce costs by minimizing the number of ingredients needed and simplifying the cooking process. They also tend to rely on pre-packaged and pre-portioned ingredients, which reduces waste and helps to keep costs down.

Also, fast food restaurants typically have lower overhead costs than sit-down restaurants. They often operate in high-traffic areas with lower rent costs, and they require less space for seating and dining areas. This allows them to focus on the food preparation and service, rather than on creating an elaborate dining experience.

Alternatively:

""To begin with, allowing students to use their personal tablets and laptops has become increasingly popular, even in middle schools. Although controversial, governments permit this practice because it offers advantages that are unavailable with general books or notebooks. 

For one, writing and editing letters is easier on digital devices. Users can correct mistakes with the click of a button and easily adjust letter size, access to more color options than traditional notebooks. 

Moreover, these devices enable students to search for information faster. Searching for concepts in books during class can be challenging; however, online services make it easier to find information, ensuring that students will not need extra time to understand what was taught since they can discover additional documents to aid in their learning.

Capping this off, students in a particular class can connect with each other.

1. Consider breaking up the sentence into two separate sentences to make the idea clearer: 

""A lot of schools, including some middle schools, allow students to use their own private tablets and laptop computers. In some cases, teachers even provide them.""

2. You could also clarify the meaning of ""private"" by using the word ""personal"" instead: 

""A lot of schools, including some middle schools, allow students to use their own personal tablets and laptop computers. In some cases, teachers even provide them.""

In terms of energy production, the gas turbine method has several benefits compared to other plants, including convenience of starting engine, large power output per mass, low pollutant emission such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides(NOx), etc. Especially for emission, fuels without carbon, for instance, hydrogen and ammonia, is rising as carbon neutrality policies came into effect gradually. [2] To fulfill low-emission system, gas turbine plants with fuel lean-burn can play key roll, which means combustion with excess of air, in addition to efficiency for using fuel. Currently those gas turbine combustors in industrial use adopt premixed flame for the most, which combusts with fuel and oxidizer completely before ignition, because of high effectiveness and low emission compared to diffusion flame, which is fuel and oxidizer separately enter the combustion chamber.

For can-annular type combustors, which combined type and annular type combustor, are commonly used on industrial fields. There are some advantages of can-annular combustors; easy to maintain as each can be removed easily and wored on independently. [3] 
On the other hand, there are some risks about fuel lean premixed combustors, including a risk due to premixed flame, which have been resolved to some extent today. The most challenging problem is combustion instability, in presence of lean-burn. Moreover to the combustion instability of the combustor itself, the can-annular type combustors have a additional combustion instability about area called a ""cross-talk section"" that interacts due to the joining at the end of each combustor as Fig.1 shown. This area is used to equalize the pressure in each can [3]. Although instability of can-annular combustor is notable, relatively little research were conducted about combustion instabililty with respect to combustor-to-combustor interaction.

532,20233218-SW-5-1-02,SW,20233218,5,1,2,"<essay>The synthesis of blue quantum dots (QDs) has been studied with a variety of materials used. Blue quantum dots commonly have sizes of 2-6 nm and a peak wavelength of 400-500 nm. In order to have short wavelengths, these QDs are extremely small, so there exists difficulty in synthesizing them due to several factors such as Ostwald ripening, surface ligand effect, and quantum confinement effect. Depending on the precursors used, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of these quantum dots may also vary. PLQY is the ratio of the number of photons emitted through photoluminescence to the number of photons absorbed by the material, and is an important criterion for determining the efficiency of QDs. In this section, three recent studies regarding the synthesis of blue quantum dots will be presented. Along with the efficiency of the quantum dots, the struggle for minimizing the use of harmful elements is also being emphasized, so studies about CdSe quantum dots which contain hazardous cadmium will be excluded for this section.
One major example of blue quantum dot research is the use of indium and phosphorus precursors, resulting in indium phosphide (InP) QDs which are a type of III-V QDs. In 2020, Zhang et al.[1] reported the synthesis of blue InP quantum dots which have a structure of an InP core and a ZnS shell. For the core, (DMA)3P, ZnI2, and InI3 were used, while for the shell, zinc stearate and 1-dodecanethiol were used. The use of (DMA)3P is highly advantageous because it has high stability when exposed in the air and does not generate toxic PH3¬ gas. Since InP core by itself has low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), ZnS which has a large bandgap as a shell can enhance the PLQY up to 45%. The resulting quantum dots had an emission wavelength of 468 nm, which grants the QD to have a blue emission. What is striking in this study was that this wavelength of 468 nm was the shortest wavelength among the reported InP quantum dots at the time. Moreover, full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) was 47 nm, which is considered narrow among blue InP quantum dots.
Meanwhile, other groups of researchers focused on the use of metal halide perovskites for the synthesis of blue QDs, owing to their high stability and excellent photophysical. In 2019, Bi et al.[2] reported that CsPb1-xCuxX3 (X = Br, Br/Cl) perovskite QDs have a potential for being used as blue QDs that possess great optical properties. CsPb1-xCuxX3 perovskite QDs are synthesized by doping Cu2+ ions to the CsPbX3 quantum dots. The larger Pb2+ ions are substituted with smaller Cu2+ ions, leading to a contraction of the octahedral structure and eventually a much more stable lattice. These blue quantum dots show an emission peak in the range of 450-460 nm, accompanied by a narrow PL linewidth. The PLQY was as high as 95% when the x value was 0.07. In particular, these doped quantum dots had high thermal stability due to the stability of the modified lattice structure. The CsPb0.93Cu0.07Br3 QDs retained their PLQY value to 35% under annealing temperatures of 250oC, while the undoped QDs showed a sharp decrease in their PLQY value to 1% at same temperatures. The superb optical properties and high thermal stabilities with the use of metal halide perovskites may pave the way for developing blue-emitting optoelectronic devices with improved stability.
Metal halide perovskites surely account for a crucial part in the blue quantum dot synthesis study. However, the problem with these quantum dots is the fact that metal halide perovskites mostly consist of lead ions, which are notorious for toxicity to human bodies. To cope with this issue, a number of researchers aimed to reduce or even eliminate the lead part of these perovskites by substituting lead with other components. For instance, in 2017, Zhang et al.[3] reported the synthesis of blue quantum dots using lead-free Cs3Sb2Br9. These inorganic antimony halide perovskite quantum dots are synthesized via modifying the structure of traditional CsSbBr3 perovskites, by moving every third Sb layer along <111> direction. The QDs resulted in an emission peak of 410 nm, and the PLQY of 46% could be obtained. This value of PLQY was notable in that it was much higher than that of the counterparts with similar emission peaks. The high value of PLQY can be attributed to the higher proportion of Br that reduces the surface trapper effect, and a large exciton binding energy. In addition, the FWHM value was 41 nm, which is also a much improved value compared to previous studies.</essay>","I did not identify any major grammar mistakes or awkward expressions in your draft.

One common convention is to spell out numbers from one to ten, and use numerals for numbers 11 and above. But it's also important to consider the context and purpose of your writing when deciding how to present numerical information. Well done!",4,Answer,,"This paper introduces a parametrically parsimonious model for yield curves that has the ability to represent the shapes generally associated with yield curves: monotonic, humped, and S shaped. We find that the model explains 96% of the variation in bill yields across maturities during the period 1981-83. The movement of the parameters through time reflects and confirms a change in Federal Reserve monetary policy in late 1982. The ability of the fitted curves to predict the price of the long-term Treasury bond with a correlation of .96 suggests that the model captures important at- tributes of the yield/ maturity relation.

The need for a parsimonious model of the yield curve was recognized by Milton Friedman (1977, p. 22) when he stated, ""Students of statistical demand functions might find it more productive to examine how the whole term structure of yields can be described more compactly by a few parameters."" The purpose of this paper is to introduce a simple, parsimonious model that is flexible enough to represent the range of shapes generally associated with yield curves: mono- tonic, humped, and S shaped. The ability of the model to fit U.S. Treasury bill yields and to predict the price of a long-term Treasury bond suggests to us that the model succeeds in the objective set by Friedman. Potential applications of parsimonious yield curve models include demand functions (Friedman had in mind money demand), testing of theories of the term structure of interest rates, and graphic display for informative purposes. The fitting of yield curves to yield/maturity data goes back at least to the pioneering efforts of David Durand (1942), whose method of fitting was to draw a monotonic envelope under the scatter of points in a way that seemed to him subjectively reasonable. Yield may be transformed to present value, and J. Huston McCulloch (1971, 1975) has proposed approximating the present value function by a piecewise polynomial spline fitted to price data. Gary Shea (1982, 1985) has shown that the resulting yield function tends to bend sharply toward the end of the maturity range observed in the sample. This would seem to be a most unlikely property of a true yield curve relation and also suggests that these models would not be useful for prediction outside the sample maturity range. Other researchers have fitted a variety of parametric models to yield curves, including Cohen, Kramer, and Waugh (1966), Fisher (1966), Echols and Elliott (1976), Dobson (1978), Heller and Khan (1979), and Chambers, Carleton, and Waldman (1984). Some of these are based on polynomial regression, and all include at least a linear term that would force extrapolated very long term rates to be unboundedly large (either positive or negative) despite their abilities to fit closely within the range of the data. Vasicek and Fong (1982) have recommended exponential splines as an alternative to polynomial splines. In a comparison of the two spline methodologies, Shea (1984) finds that exponential splines are subject to the same shortcomings that polynomial splines are, essentially because polynomial splines are used after a change of variables. Students of the term to maturity structure of interest rates have invariably described yield curves that are essentially monotonic, humped, or, occasionally, S shaped. This consistency is strikingly evident in the long historical record of subjectively drawn curves presented by Wood (1983). A similar consistency is shown by the yield curves plotted in Malkiel (1966, pp. 13, 14) and in the Treasury Bulletin. This is true even of yield curves based on polynomial methods. For example, those plotted by Chambers et al. (1984) reveal the explosive tendencies of polynomials only toward the end of the fitted maturity range. A class of functions that readily generates the typical yield curve shapes is that associated with solutions to differential or difference equations. The expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates provides heuristic motivation for investigating this class since, if spot rates are generated by a differential equation, then forward rates, being forecasts, will be the solution to the equations",FALSE,TRUE,NO-UPTAKE,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL

These results indicate that both excitatory and inhibitory neurons fire regularly. In state II, where asynchronized state, the timing of firing of neuron is not synchronized (Figs. 2(b)). However, we found that in some cases, they are synchronized weakly (from 10.1 to 10.3 s). In that case, we found both slow and fast oscillation are shown. In state III, we found that the timing of spikes is aligned rather than synchronized (Figs. 2(c)). We found that not all neurons fire for each peak of oscillations and the neurons are fire irregularly (vEi, vIi). In addition, we found that two different synchronized states have different oscillation frequency (Figs. 2(a), 2(b)).",FALSE,TRUE,NO-UPTAKE,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL,TRUE,SUCCESSFUL

When you're revising your draft, try to use active voice as much as possible. This will make your writing more clear and concise. However, if you come across a situation where passive voice is more appropriate, go ahead and use it. Just make sure that you're using it intentionally and not just out of habit. Remember, the goal of scientific writing is to communicate your ideas clearly and effectively, so always keep your audience in mind when making decisions about voice and sentence structure.
