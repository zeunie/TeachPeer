However, in the lecture, the professor disagrees with all of them and explains why they are unlikely to work. First, the reading suggests replanting the Torreya tree in its original habitat in Florida, where it used to grow well because of a special microclimate. But the professor says that climate change has changed the region, and the microclimate no longer exists. So, putting the tree back in that area will not help. 
Second, the reading proposes moving Torreya to a new, colder region in the north. The idea is that Torreya might grow better in that kind of climate. The professor disagrees and gives an example of the black locust tree. It was moved to a new area and grew too fast, causing damage to the local ecosystem. 
Finally, the reading recommends growing Torreya in research centers. This way, scientists can protect and study the tree. However, the professor argues that trees kept in such places lose their natural resistance to diseases. Also, it's difficult to recreate the large and diverse environment that the tree needs to survive in the wild.

Many foreign workers in Korea have a difficulty in something. Can you guess what it is? It’s working hour (time). They usually have had hard time to adopt Korea working system. Korea works too much. Even though it decreased than before, the A of Korean work up to 55 hours per week. So, today, I’ll discuss why There should be a 4-day work week. Now, I’ll give you more details.

To begin with, we can do more in work if we get relax more. Think about When you take over the night studying. Was the efficiency good? Maybe not. It’s same as workers. They should get relax more, take a sleep and then come to work place with high quality of energy and condition.

Secondly, if there is a 4-day work week, the increasing of spending would be expected. Spending could be a good for economics. Many can cycle and small marketers can sell more things. For example, Past in Korea, when it changed to 5-day work week from 6-day work week, Many people worried that workers efficiency will get down. However, people spend a lot of time and Money so the economics could be circulated.

Lastly, it can be welfare to workers time take off one day. They do not need to use their personal holiday to their work place. Everybody get a break. So, people can live more happily.

Then, how to make it for real? I’ll suggest some ways to bring it.
First way: work free on wednesday. If we take a break on wednesday, we only work two days directly. Wednesday is profit for holiday because it located middle of weeks days.
Second way: replace work free days zig-zag.

Even though it decreased than before, the A of Korean work up to 55 hours per week. So, today, I’ll discuss why There should be a 4-day work week. Now, I’ll give you more details.

To begin with, we can do more in work if we get relax more. Think about When you take over the night studying. Was the efficiency good? Maybe not. It’s same as workers. They should get relax more, take a sleep and then come to work place with high quality of energy and condition.

Secondly, if there is a 4-day work week, the increasing of spending would be expected. Spending could be a good for economics. Many can cycle and small marketers can sell more things. For example, Past in Korea, when it changed to 5-day work week from 6-day work week, Many people worried that workers efficiency will get down. However, people spend a lot of time and Money so the economics could be circulated.

Lastly, it can be welfare to workers time take off one day. They do not need to use their personal holiday to their work place. Everybody get a break. So, people can live more happily.

Then, how to make it for real? I’ll suggest some ways to bring it.
First way: work free on wednesday. If we take a break on wednesday, we only work two days directly. Wednesday is profit for holiday because it located middle of weeks days.
Second way: replace work free days zig-zag. For example, people whose birth-year ends with 0,5 → Mon, 1,6 → Tue, 2,7 → Wednesday, 3,8 → Thur, 4,9 → Fri work free.","TITLE: Benefits of Reading Books.

There are many people in the world who find enjoy in a specific activity. Can you guess what it could be? It is reading book. They have had many happy feelings while doing so. Books can be fun. Even though it decreased in the past years, A big number of people reads many books every month. So today, I will discuss why reading books is very beneficial. Now, let's explore this idea.

Firstly, reading can help to feel relax after a long day. Think about When you are on a vacation without any plan. Is it relaxing? Probably not. It’s same with reading books late at night. Books should be read in comfortable time, take a sit and enjoy every page with a great mood.

Secondly, if we read various books, the increasing of knowledge can be expected. More knowledge could be advantage for job. Many can understand new concepts and small discussions become easier. Past in history, when new kinds of literature appeared, many thought it’s not efficient. But, people gain insight so knowledge expand widely.

Lastly, books are important for every age in life. No one need to have special book or special shelf. Everybody find a story they like. So, people can have more joy.

So, how to make reading a more popular habit? I’ll offer some ideas.

First idea: read as group on weekend. If we read together on saturday, it make the activity social. 
Second idea: read based by year of experience. For example, people with 5 year of reading experience: classic, 2 year: fiction, and new readers: start with short stories.","[{'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'who find enjoy in <error>a</error> specific activity.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'They <error>have had</error> many happy feelings while doing so.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'Even though it decreased in the past years, <error>A</error> big number of people reads many books every month.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Missing thesis statement', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'So today, I will discuss why reading books is very beneficial.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'organization'}, {'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'Think about When you are on a vacation without any plan.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Comma splice error', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'Books should be read in comfortable time, take a sit and enjoy every page with a great mood.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_007', 'evidence': 'More knowledge could be advantage for job.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_008', 'evidence': 'Everybody <error>find</error> a story they like.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Capitalization error', 'kc_id': 'kc_009', 'evidence': 'It’s <error>same</error> with reading books late at night.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'No overall conclusion', 'kc_id': 'kc_010', 'evidence': 'Second idea: read based by year of experience.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'organization'}]",1758630133133,low-uptake

To say an extremely economic system could collapse. The world is based on a 5-day work week now. Through many researchers and historians, people believed 2 free work days are enough, and the countries selected that policy. However, let's suppose that one country changes it to a 4-day work week, so every company should give workers 3 free days. The first thing that will happen is that the GDP of the country will decrease. This will happen naturally because the time for working has been decreased.

For example, hobbies and self-paced courses online can encourages people to develop new skills and expand their knowledge base. As such, I believe that lifelong learning benefit individuals greatly, a premise which will be elaborated on below.

Firstly, it is necessary to possess a mind open to acquiring new knowledge throughout one's lifetime. Many societies presenting opportunities for education at different stages of life, such as workshops, certifications, or on-the-job training, which are aligned with one changing needs. Without embracing these opportunity, individuals may miss out on the societal advancements and personal satisfaction achieved through continuous education. Take learning a new language, for instance, it opens up cultural understanding and broader career prospects, promoting even more connections globally. 

Additionally, staying engaged in learning develop resilience and the ability to adapt in face of new challenges. With technology advancing rapidly, it becomes important that individuals juggles between keeping up with trends and maintaining relevant skills. Platforms offering courses help in this transition, equipping learners with needed tools to remain competent.

It accessibly enters our space through platforms like Spotify, radio, YouTube, and music apps. However, not everyone parses this art form thoroughly to understand its depth, message, or cultural implications, which can be especially risky without critical listening. Thus, I argue that music significantly influences people's emotions and perspectives, which is suggested in the subsequent text.

To commence with, people should develop a nuanced appreciation for music's cultural significance and message. Various songs depict themes such as love, violence, and social topics, often clashing with one's personal beliefs. Take for example, rap music—a genre that openly discusses societal issues such as racial disparity and economic struggles. Some listeners might interpret these issues superficially, thinking, ""This is the lifestyle to aspire to!"" which might distort their perception, not to be banned but needs mature understanding.

Moreover, critically interpreting music's lyrics requires astute thinking, such as identifying the authenticity of an artist's message or intentions. Notably, social media platforms where artists share their songs without filters can cause widespread beliefs based on unstated ideas, leading to unfounded opinions.

Furthermore, the ease of music streaming enables individuals to indulge habitually, overconsuming media to the extent that they neglect important responsibilities. This overindulgence can often interfere with one's productivity and prioritisation of tasks, reducing overall effectiveness in managing their routines.

Altogether, there are several potential benefits and detriments to absorbing music's power without analysis, although maturity can develop towards balanced consumption.","[{'description': 'Insufficient background information', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'It accessibly enters our space through platforms like Spotify, radio, YouTube, and music apps.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Sentence fragment error', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'Take for example, rap music—a genre that openly discusses societal issues such as racial disparity and economic struggles.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Punctuation error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'thinking, ""This is the lifestyle to aspire to!"" which might distort their perception, not to be banned but needs mature understanding.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'Notably, social media platforms where artists share their songs without filters can cause widespread beliefs based on unstated ideas, leading to unfounded opinions.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Run-on sentence error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'Furthermore, the ease of music streaming enables individuals to indulge habitually, overconsuming media to the extent that they neglect important responsibilities.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'No overall conclusion', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': ""Altogether, there are several potential benefits and detriments to absorbing music's power without analysis, although maturity can develop towards balanced consumption."", 'priority': 4, 'category': 'organization'}]",1758632596917,high-uptake

For first method, you should arrive at station and wait for train. For flying, you must to check-in and pass security. Imagine doing these steps without luggage. You must carry everything by hand, which becomes heavy quickly. Moreover, how can you enjoy without worry? I think traveling bring large impacts to our lives.

Experiencing culture is very beautiful in our life and society. In this prespective, traveling has changed everything. Nowadays culture is sharing over long distances we not imagine without train, plane, boat. That makes us can learn about new foods and living styles, even in a few days, over the sea, deserts, and mountains.

Experiencing new things is also great for self growth. We can share ideas and knowledge easily. For example, if you are artist, you can travel to find inspiration and techniques. When you feel misunderstood, traveling helps you connect. Handshake does not have much power. but now we can make relationships strong with traveling. Artists can learn new skills in different countries.

Traveling gives us joyful experiences such as fun, learning environment. In past, many individuals are lonely and sad because of same daily routine, same view always, etc. But we experience and grow in these adventures by following travel honestly.

Susch companies will be highly harmed if people only work 4 day a week.
Second, some workers would not like this policy to worker's labor are depend on how much time day work. And work less day means less working time and also less money. So wokers that value money than rest would not like those policy.

There is a lot of issue created by smartphones. About 5 years ago, there was a major internet blackout in South Korea. Society was disrupted and numerous businesses were affected. Many people remember it for about 5 years. Last month, there was a massive data breach and many people's privacy was compromised. Like these examples, communication devices can cause serious problems. However I believe they are crucial to our life.

First, we can connect with others easily with mobile phones. Everyday I use smartphone to contact my family and friends. Without mobile phones, I would have to send letters and wait days for a response. With communication devices, we can connect with people worldwide effortlessly.

Second, communication devices can assist in emergencies. If there's medical emergency, you can call for help immediately. If someone is stranded in remote area, a phone can alert rescue teams to locate them. We can contact specialist doctor for advice if needed. We can share information instantly. All these are possible because of communication devices.

Finally, issue started by phones isn't their fault. We aware of electricity. However no one think electricity is the one to be exitted from our life. Communication devices is similar to electricity. It is risky but it is essential. Issue arise due to not device but user.

Therefore, communication devices enable us to connect easily, provide assistance in emergencies, and issues aren’t caused by devices themselves.

First of all, flashlight is very helpful in camping. In the camp, we often need light at night to see and do things. Without flashlight, it is hard to move around in the dark night. Some people still use them in every camping trip.

Second, we use flashlights in our homes, especially when power is off. If the electricity go out, we can use a flashlight to do our activities. It is important to have one always ready in case of any emergency.

Overall, flashlight has improve our lives in many way. We might not think about it a lot, but it still important tool.

I think a four-day work week is not needed. Firstly, it will not only be unhelpful but also make the situation worse. With a longer weekend, the free time will increase, but the amount of work that a company should complete in a month does not change. Therefore, we must complete the same amount of work in a shorter period. It causes many health problems, border working life, and a lot of working at night. Eventually, a four-day work week cannot achieve its goal of making life better by providing a longer weekend.

Second, there can be many opinions that support a five-day work and two-day weekend system. It has already become a social standard. Every school and college follows that rule. But if students go to school only four days a week, it will reduce learning and cause the loss of many genius students who could lead a country.

Third, harder work brings many health problems. I wrote a short essay, but it is a very important problem. The worst problem is a lack of sleep. Experts suggest people sleep 8 hours a day, but we already cannot follow that. It may hurt more than before, and many will sleep under 5 hours in a day. A lack of sleep destroys our immune system and leads to a higher chance of many diseases, including cancer. Some may say that we can sleep more in the 3-day rest, but it will make the situation worse. We should sleep in balance.","TITLE: Food Nostalgia Experience  
Tasting food from past bring bas memories. first of all, it will not always delicious remember but also broken situation. made meal brings smell that turns weep. While the same flavors regain, the experienco of food doesn't goes away. Therefore. You must keep trying similar flavor in other days.

It cause many mixture emotions about eating food and a lots of dishes to taste suddenly. Generally, a favorite dish cannot have their own mismatch that makes moments wrse as reliving events. Besides, some people have idea that also feel similar taste for each season. ""Tradition food and holiday meal"" becomes part of everyday. Each family and friends enjoys that rule. If youngster eats flavors only on holidays, will go continue decrease fun and forgot many childhood memories which will make person strong.

Lastly, different ingredients alone brings multiple experiences. I wrote a front essay but is very serious matter. The big problem is not same cooking.

Also, we can shop from various country and buy products that we cannot find where we live. Second reason is the job creation. For instance, tech industry create numerous jobs. The technology development sector requires many workers, so many people obtain jobs there. Also, thanks to technology, we can do remote work easily. So tech industry has expanded, and it has produce large economic impact. If a country has strong tech sector, they can gain money. These everything happen because of technology.

But, I not agree that online shopping is the best way. There two reasons for it.

First, sometimes you receive the wrong item or it not like the picture showed online. Many friends of mine have bad experience with this. In fact, when you go to store, you can see and touch what you buy. It make you sure about what you getting.

Second reason, online shopping can make people lazy and not active. I heard that people who buy only online just stay at home and they don't go out often. This habit is not good for health. If people go to stores, they have to walk and maybe they exercise more.

To sum up, shopping online seem easy but it have problems too.

Second reason is we already have much time to spend our hobby time. Some people who agree 4-day work week argue that if we change work week, we spend enough time to enjoy hobby. But I think we already have enough time to spend our hobby time. Because when we rest on weekend, we consume enough time to exercise, watch movie, and so on.

They eat unhealthy foods and don’t exercise enough which can be problem. But, there are many people who wants to be healthy, and they try very hard to exercise and eat well.

One main reason why people are not healthy is because they don’t have information about nutrition. When people eat, they only think about taste. If they don’t learn about nutrition, they still the same problem even if they exercise. So, they need specific details about foods they eat, to understand what is good for them and what is not.

Another reason is exercise routines are often not effective. People try their best to follow routines, but without correct guidance, they didn’t know if they improve or not. This can make them work more harder without result. If they have proper advice, they can improve health balance between their work and personal life.

In conclusion, I think health important but not easy. People must learn the true information about food and exercise properly.

Today, I’m going to talk about exploring new hobbies. Is it necessary for everyone to have hobbies? In my case, I think exploring hobbies makes our life fun. This is a reason why I take up new hobbies during weekends. These are some reasons which support my opinion.

First, exploring hobbies leads to new joy which your leisure enriching. If you engage in different activities, there are lots of new skills (such as painting, cooking) not common for you. These may help you to get a new passion. Furthermore, not be confined to usual routine can make you get new happiness. For example, in my case, I started hiking in mountains, one of the most enjoyable activities in the world, when I was in college. To feel the difference between indoor and outdoor activities actually indoor activities become monotonous fastly which makes life a little boring. In contrast, outdoor activities change seasonally which makes them diverse. I also tried birdwatching and at local park, I saw many birds that I had learned about during biology class. So exploring hobbies help you to get a new joy.

Second, you can have a bond with new friends. Bonding is important because when you feeling lonely, you can receive a motivation and comfort from your friends. For example, when you join a club, a bond with members, other groups is essential to keep your interest active. So more various friends you meet, more joyful your leisure.

However, now a new idea about education has emerged; hybrid learning due to the flexibility it offer. I believe this idea is not great. Let me tell you why I feel that way.

To begin with, if we implement hybrid learning, the quality of education will be lessen. Think simple. Class hours are reduced, and the level of understanding are decreased. Similarly, if we cut classroom times, the time that student fully engage in learning are diminished, leading to take longer to grasp certain subjects. 

Additionally, I feel increasing in-person classes according to school's resources is better than enforcing hybrid mode. There are various conditions in schools: some schools can manage with online tools, while other school need more physical classes. Furthermore, based on the term or changes in technology, the learning mode might demand change. Therefore, I support adapting the number of in-person interactions instead of adopting hybrid learning. 

There are several reason backing my thoughts. For instance, if classroom time reduced, teaching load per teacher increased, leading to unexpected repercussions. Nonetheless, the main issue of these reasons remain constant, ""reducing class time"".

Today, let me explain the benefits of walking. How often do we consider walking as exercise? In my case, I believe walking makes life more active. So I prefer to walk instead of using vehicle whenever possible. Let me provide reasons that support my view.

First, walking provide a way to relax and think clearly. Walking to somewhere, you notice many things like tree, sky, and sounds of nature not obvious in cars. These can give you peace of mind. Moreover, walking regularly make you feel better mentally. For example, my own experience, I used to walk around my neighborhood park every morning. To compare the stress level before and after walking, actually my stress decrease and I felt happy. In contrast, sitting inside whole day increase stress levels. I also met a man with his dog in the park, and we discussed many topics. So walking helps to give peace and clarity.

Second, you stay fit and healthy by walking. Health is crucial because when illness strikes, support and encouragement might come from unexpected places. For instance, reducing weight or maintaining a healthy heart can be enhanced by walking. Hence, more frequent you walk, more benefits you gain.

Finally, to sum up, there are a few advantages, clarity and health, of choosing to walk.

After the automobile appear, we could move far away in a single day. For example, Sunbi of Josun moved before a month for taking test before. But now on, we can move Seoul to Busan 4~5 hours with automobiles. This effect our moving range and economically, culturally improvement. We can say those automobile made modern society.

After the automobile appear, we could move far away in a single day. For example, Sunbi of Josun moved a month before for taking test. But now on, we can move Seoul to Busan 4~5 hours with automobiles. This affects our moving range and economically, culturally improvements. We can say those automobile made modern society.

While the smartphone emerge, we could communicate immediately with others. For instance, many developers need days to share ideas before. But, now it takes only seconds through a smartphone.

Imagine your country in a crisis? Undoubtedly, you will text to emergency numbers. Because of the smartphone, you can protect your family and essential data. I am not arguing the smartphone does not cause issues. Just I try to show that smartphone has problems. Yet we should also understand smartphone also provide solutions too. Nowadays, we can receive help in just 10 min by emergency services. If you feel unsafe? Smartphone can help you.
Consider the situation if we banned smartphone due to their social issues. For sure, I say our technology, economy, government will be in trouble.

 I think there are three qualities of good roommate. 
 First, not be noisy. Do you know about biological time? Bio time is pattern of when we sleep, eat. It is important to keep rhythm. According to research, if bio time is broken, expect life decreases. Therefore, we have to be respect bio time of our roommate. But each people have various bio time. When you talk with your friends, somebody is sleeping. So we should be quiet to be respect bio time of our roommate.
 Second, be clear. When I was 17, in high school, I have dirty roommate. He didn't take a shower, throw something which he had eaten. Our room is dirtier, and finally we don't have enough space to do something and smell like garbage can. This is the worst experience in my life. After this experience, I think cleanliness is very important. So I think when we live with somebody, we should be clear.
 Lastly, be respect privacy time. Even though we live with somebody, we want privacy time. If we can't be respect privacy time, we will be tired and maybe fight with roommate. Privacy time is one of the most important in life. It is can increase creativity, and be charge energy to work. So we should be respect privacy time.

Old people can learn new things and stay connected with family far away. So, people become more knowledgeable and informed about world. Technology also made education is accessible to all, even in remote area. Second benefit is the connection it offers. For example, social media let us meet many people.

110490073975901912274,"Many university students consider whether they have to study abroad. Some students apply being an exchange student, other students study in only their contries. In my opinion, I think that students should study abroad. Let me explain three reasons.
 First of all, students can experience various views. For example, in France, mathematics is based on logic which France has only. Therefore, if students study in country which has it's own advantages in students' interested field, they can experience various views. 
 Second, students can learn from famous professor. For example, in other country, there are Dokinson, Karl Seigon, Michael Sandel, who are famous people in their fields. However, there are few chances to meet them in students' countries. Therefore, if students study in country which has famous professor, they can learn many things.
 Lastly, students can take part in a symposium of subject in which they are interested. There are many symposiums of various subjects in other countries.

Some students apply being exchange students, other students study in only their countries. In my opinion, I think that students should study abroad. Let me explain three reasons.
 First of all, students can experience various views. For example, in France, mathematics is based on logic which France has only. Therefore, if students study in country which has it's own advantages in students' interested field, they can experience various views. 
 Second, students can learn from famous professor. For example, in other country, there are Dokinson, Karl Seigon, Michael Sandel, who are famous people in their fields. However, there are few chances to meet them in students' countries. Therefore, if students study in countries which have famous professor, they can learn many things.
 Lastly, students can take part in a symposium of subject in which they are interested. There are many symposiums of various subjects in other countries. Students can share their papers, review other's papers, and communicate their opinions and feedbacks. So, if students take part in a symposium in other countries, they can improve their research skills.
 For these reasons, I think that students should study abroad.

Some people enjoy novels, others are more interested in non-fiction books. Personally, I think people should read more. Let me give three reasons. First of all, reading introduces many ideas. For example, in science fiction novels, the future technology is described in detail which only exists in author's imagination. Therefore, when people read books with vivid imagination, they can encounter many ideas. Second, readers can learn from great authors. For instance, in classic literature, there are authors like Dickens, Jane Austen, Tolstoy, who are respected figures in their field. However, few opportunities exist to understand their genius without reading their works. Hence, if readers choose books by famous authors, they can gain deep insights. Lastly, readers can discuss books in group which they are part of. There are many book discussion groups where people can gather. Readers can present their thoughts, review others' opinions, and exchange their ideas. Thus, by joining book discussion groups, readers can enhance their understanding. For these reasons, I believe that people should read more. It will introduce many ideas, allow readers to learn from great authors, and participate in book discussion groups.","[{'description': 'Pluralization error', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'Some people enjoy novels, others are more interested in non-fiction books.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Possessive pronoun error', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': ""For example, in science fiction novels, the future technology is described in detail which only exists in author's imagination."", 'priority': 4, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Determiner agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'Second, readers can learn from great authors.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Pluralization error', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'Hence, if readers choose books by famous authors, they can gain deep insights.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Weak or missing transitions', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'Thus, by joining book discussion groups, readers can enhance their understanding.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'organization'}]",1758719122237,high-uptake

Of course, transport are necessary for mobility. But most cars release more pollution then acceptable levels to atmosphere.

Last winter, I have decided to adopt a cat from the shelter near my home. The cat was very playful and it brung me so many happy times. Pets can be an incredible part of our lives, offering company and support when we need it most.

In the modern world, pet become one of best companions for people. We can have cats, dogs, birds, and even reptiles. Pet is not only our friend but also can serve as a watch animal or therapy assistant. Then what would happen if everyone could have pet at home?

Firstly, having a pet is great for emotional wellbeing. They often cheer us up, especially dogs who love play and attention. It is scientifically proven that pet helps reduce stress and loneliness. Having dog or cat can turn sad day into happy time.

Second, pets can teach us a responsibility. Growing up with a pet mean you have learn to feed, clean, and care for another living being. It is a great lesson for children and adults alike. In some cases, pet can also be a safety measure, alerting owners in dangerous situations.

Third, pets create bond with their owners like no other. They never judge and always welcome you home. Someone might think pets are expensive but benefit they provide is worth. For instance, therapy dogs are crucial part for many people's lives.

Some people think pets make mess and hard to handle. However, the joy and companionship pets bring is irreplaceable. Therefore, instead of banning pets, we should finding ways to include them more positively into our lives.

Having a pet improve many aspects of life and enhance our happiness.","[{'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'Then what would happen if everyone could have pet at home?', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Lack of examples and details', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'Someone might think pets are expensive but benefit they provide is worth.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'No overall conclusion', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'Having a pet improve many aspects of life and enhance our happiness.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'organization'}, {'description': 'Spelling or typo error', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'The cat was very playful and it brung me so many happy times.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'In the modern world, pet become one of best companions for people.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'In the modern world, pet become one of best companions for people.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_007', 'evidence': 'In the modern world, pet become one of best companions for people.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Capitalization error', 'kc_id': 'kc_008', 'evidence': 'Pet is not only our friend but also can serve as a watch animal or therapy assistant.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_009', 'evidence': 'Last winter, I have decided to adopt a cat from the shelter near my home.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Punctuation error', 'kc_id': 'kc_010', 'evidence': 'It is scientifically proven that pet helps reduce stress and loneliness.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Comma splice error', 'kc_id': 'kc_011', 'evidence': 'Having dog or cat can turn sad day into happy time.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_012', 'evidence': 'Growing up with a pet mean you have learn to feed, clean, and care for another living being.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_013', 'evidence': 'They never judge and always welcome you home.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_014', 'evidence': 'Therefore, instead of banning pets, we should finding ways to include them more positively into our lives.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Spelling or typo error', 'kc_id': 'kc_015', 'evidence': 'However, the joy and companionship pets bring is irreplaceable.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Spelling or typo error', 'kc_id': 'kc_016', 'evidence': 'having a pet improve many aspects of life and enhance our happiness.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}]",1758720460868,high-uptake

But after Korea became little strong country, people work 5 days in one week and many people think this decision was right. However, is it good to reduce working days 5 to 4 like the past? Of course 4-day work week will have both good and bad points. But in my opinion, I think 4-day work week should not be done because it has more disadventages than adventages.
 First, if we work only 4 days in one week, there will be more work in one day. Suppose that you have work to do in one week. It is very easy to think that there will be more work to do in one day if you do this work only 4 days, not 5 days. This is not good for you and company, too. It is because it can cause health problems or mental issue and also the quality of work will be down.
 Second, not working long time is not good. If we work only 4 days in week, that mean we don't work almost half of the week. In my opinion, this will decrease working ability. It is easy to forgot the things to do in working days and also it can affect quality or time, too. For example, if I study only 4 days in a week, my studing ability may decrease. I will forgot the things I learn while 3days that I don't study.

This is why you rarely see insects during the months they are inactive. However, we do not fully understand how all insects handle the cold. More research is needed to discover more about insects winter habits.
First, some insects migrate to warm places. We can think of this like birds do. If insects can find a better place to live during winter, they will go. But not all insects migrate, only certain species do.
Second, insects have natural antifreeze in their bodies. When it is cold, this antifreeze stop their body fluids from freezing. This is another way they survive the winter surprisingly.

Second, some workers would not like this policy because worker's labor are depend on how much time day work. And work less day means less working time and also less money.

First, without attending schools in person, students feel unmotivated. Anyone can believe learning from home gives flexibility. However, I think classrooms offer regular motivation completely.

Second, it may cause issues with communication. Teachers and students are connecting through technology. If we rely only on remote education, regardless of its flexibility, interactions of students decline dramatically. Because the time spent face-to-face reduces significantly. Then, naturally, student morale will drop, and learning will suffer. It is a big concern to consider before promoting remote education.

Finally, study patterns of students can cause many disturbances. Original way of attending school keep students on track that can’t change students’ study habits abruptly. With online classes, we do often miss out on peer interactions then habits break. In contrast, traditional way keeps study pattern steady. So it can affect on learning like longer screen times.

 First, a vegetarian diet may lack in essential nutrients like proteins and vitamins. This is crucial for maintaining the good health and proper functioning of the body.
 Second, the food options can be limited for vegetarian. The term 'eating out' become difficult when there are few vegetarian dishes. Some restaurants do not provide vegetarian-friendly menus.
 Third, there is a concern that vegetarian meals might not be tasty. Eating enjoyable meals is important, but if meals are less flavorful, it may discourage some people to take vegetarian diet.

Many foreign workers in Korea have a difficulty in something. Can you guess what it is? It’s working hour (time). They usually have had hard time to adopt Korea working system. Korea works too much. Even though it decreased than before, the A of Korean work up to 55 hours per week. So, today, I’ll discuss why There should be a 4-day work week. Now, I’ll give you more details.

To begin with, we can do more in work if we get relax more. Think about When you take over the night studying. Was the efficiency good? Maybe not. It’s same as workers. They should get relax more, take a sleep and then come to work place with high quality of energy and condition.

Secondly, if there is a 4-day work week, the increasing of spending would be expected. Spending could be a good for economics. Many can cycle and small marketers can sell more things. For example, Past in Korea, when it changed to 5-day work week from 6-day work week, Many people worried that workers efficiency will get down. However, people spend a lot of time and Money so the economics could be circulated.

Lastly, it can be welfare to workers time take off one day. They do not need to use their personal holiday to their work place. Everybody get a break. So, people can live more happily.

Then, how to make it for real? I’ll suggest some ways to bring it.
First way: work free on wednesday. If we take a break on wednesday, we only work two days directly. Wednesday is profit for holiday because it located middle of weeks days.

Many foreign workers in Korea have a difficulty in something. Can you guess what it is? It’s working hour (time). They usually have had hard time to adopt Korea working system. Korea works too much. Even though it decreased than before, the A of Korean work up to 55 hours per week. So, today, I’ll discuss why There should be a 4-day work week. Now, I’ll give you more details.

To begin with, we can do more in work if we get relax more. Think about When you take over the night studying. Was the efficiency good? Maybe not. It’s same as workers. They should get relax more, take a sleep and then come to work place with high quality of energy and condition.

Secondly, if there is a 4-day work week, the increasing of spending would be expected. Spending could be a good for economics. Many can cycle and small marketers can sell more things. For example, Past in Korea, when it changed to 5-day work week from 6-day work week, Many people worried that workers efficiency will get down. However, people spend a lot of time and Money so the economics could be circulated.

Lastly, it can be welfare to workers time take off one day. They do not need to use their personal holiday to their work place. Everybody get a break. So, people can live more happily.

Then, how to make it for real? I’ll suggest some ways to bring it.
First way: work free on wednesday. If we take a break on wednesday, we only work two days directly. Wednesday is profit for holiday because it located middle of weeks days.
Second way: replace work free days zig-zag. For example, people whose birth-year ends with 0,5 → Mon, 1,6 → Tue, 2,7 → Wednesday, 3,8 → Thur, 4,9 → Fri work free.","TITLE: The Importance of Reducing Plastic Waste.

Many communities around the world have a serious issue in something. Can you guess what it is? It’s waste plastic. They usually are have hard time to handle the problem. The world use too much plastic. Even though some countries have taken steps, the amount of plastic waste continues to rising every year. So, today, I’ll discuss why we need to reduce plastic waste. Now, I’ll give you more details.

First, reducing plastic waste can help protect wildlife. Think about When you see picture of animals trapped in plastic. Was the impact good? Definitely not. Animals should have environment free from plastic, so they can live without harm and disruption.

Secondly, people would benefit from cleaner environments if less plastic used. Cleaner areas could attract tourists, which is good for economics. For example, Some regions, when they cleaned up beaches from plastics, seen an increase in tourism revenue. Therefore, reducing plastic can support economic growth.

Lastly, it can improve healthcare systems. Waste plastics can cause serious health risk over time. Everybody benefit from cleaner environments, so communities can become more healthy places.

Then, how to achieve this? I’ll suggest some ways to reduce plastic effectively.
First way: promote reusable products in markets. If markets adopt eco-friendly policies, we can cut down on plastic usage significantly.
Second way: implement stronger regulations on plastic production. For example, governments whose policies restrict plastic usage can see significant waste reduction.","[{'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'Many communities around the world have a serious issue in something.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Missing thesis statement', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'So, today, I’ll discuss why we need to reduce plastic waste.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'organization'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'The world use too much plastic.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Insufficient background information', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'People would benefit from cleaner environments if less plastic used.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'Animals should have environment free from plastic,', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Capitalization error', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'Some regions, when they cleaned up beaches from plastics, seen an increase in tourism revenue.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Run-on sentence error', 'kc_id': 'kc_007', 'evidence': 'For example, governments whose policies restrict plastic usage can see significant waste reduction.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}]",1759233780312,low-uptake

Second, efficiency is more important than spending long hours at work. I think concentrating for a short time and achieving the best results is the most effective way to work. In Europe, some companies have already adopted a 4-day work week because they believe efficiency is the most important factor.

Third, companies can hire more employees. With a 4-day work week, each person may earn slightly less, allowing companies to employ more people. More employees bring diverse ideas, which can help the company develop and innovate.

Second reason is we already have much time to spend our hobby time. Some people who agree 4-day work week argue that if we change work week, we spend enough time to enjoy hobby.

Second reason is time consumption. Some people say exercising requires much free time every day. But they already spend enough time working, and relaxation. People also need spend time with family and friends in weekend. Balance between work and rest time is important.

First, making budget can really help you. It helps you track where your money are going and how much you are spending. Contrary to buying things without care, budgeting allows you to plan your expense.

Second, you should think about invest in stocks or mutual funds. Simple saving is good, but invest can increase your money over time. However, it is important to know risks are involved. You need to research about investment options.

Thirdly, avoid to buy expensive items if they are not urgent. Luxury products often will cost you lots of money. Think if you really need them or if there's a affordable alternative.

Secondly, dogs can help to protect the home. For example, some dogs is trained to guard home. However, cats usually cannot do this same thing. Therefore, if people have a dog, it can protect the home from danger. Lastly, dogs can bring more fun to family. Playing fetch or going for walks make enrich family activities.

I think a four-day work week is not needed. Firstly, it will not only be unhelpful but also make the situation worse. With a longer weekend, the free time will increase, but the amount of work that a company should complete in a month does not change. Therefore, we must complete the same amount of work in a shorter period. It causes many health problems, border working life, and a lot of working at night. Eventually, a four-day work week cannot achieve its goal of making life better by providing a longer weekend.

Eating at fast food is not healthy for body. Firstly, it is not only unwise, but also make people less healthy. Eating food high in fat and low in nutrients cause weight increase, and makes immune system weak. Therefore, this can lead to more health problems. It give people heart disease, diabetes, and other illness. Thus, fast food cannot make you healthy and happy.

Second, some may think fast food is convenient and tasty, it is not as good as home-cooked meals. It also damage family time, parents do not teach children to cook. Cooking together social event and create strong family bonds.

Third, fast foods are expensive than cooking at home. I wrote this essay short, but it is important topic. The worst problem is money wastage. People spend more, they cannot save money for future needs. Eating at home is cost effective, help save lots money in long run.

I believe that a four-day work week is unnecessary. Not only would it be unhelpful, but it could actually make the situation worse. Although having a longer weekend may seem attractive, the total amount of work a company must complete in a month does not change. This means employees would be forced to finish the same amount of work in a shorter period. As a result, they would face more stress, irregular working hours, and more late-night work. Eventually, a four-day work week would fail to achieve its goal of improving people’s lives.

Secondly, the current five-day work and two-day weekend system is already well established as a social standard. Schools and universities follow this schedule as well. If students attended school only four days a week, it would reduce learning time and possibly result in the loss of talented individuals who could become future leaders.

Lastly, more intense working days could lead to serious health issues. The biggest problem is lack of sleep. Experts recommend eight hours of sleep per day, but many people already fail to meet that standard. With a compressed work schedule, people may end up sleeping less than five hours a day. Chronic sleep deprivation weakens the immune system and increases the risk of various diseases, including cancer. Some might argue that people can catch up on sleep during a three-day weekend, but irregular sleep patterns only make things worse.

However, I think technology is the main reason of modern progress, so it is essential for our growth. First of all, we can access information so quickly by technology. it is not just for us. What we learn and share can be also exchanged. So we can watch videos or read articles from other country, which people couldn't access before. And we can connect with so many communities and get various experiences that we can't get in our local area. Second reasons is the educational impact. For example, technology help a lot of students. Education technology industry needs so many innovations, so many people can learn new skills. And thanks to technology, we can communicate globally easily. so online education industry has developed, and it also has made significant educational impacts. if platforms have good content that can attract learners, they can gain a lot of users. These all thing can be achieved due to technology. Lastly, it made learning more accessible, so not only usual students, but also learners that hard to access resources can study comfortably. Although students can't attend physically, now they can attend classes anywhere by technology. In conclusion, even though technology cause some issues, its benefit is much more critical, and it is vital for our development.","[{'description': 'Insufficient background information', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'First of all, we can access information so quickly by technology.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'No overall conclusion', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'In conclusion, even though technology cause some issues, its benefit is much more critical, and it is vital for our development.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'organization'}, {'description': 'Comma splice error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'For now, so many people use smartphones, and browse the web for information or entertainment.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'Second reasons is the educational impact.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'if platforms have good content that can attract learners, they can gain a lot of users.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': ""Although students can't attend physically, now they can attend classes anywhere by technology."", 'priority': 4, 'category': 'language'}]",1759316634380,high-uptake
117559587884453217689,"I think visual media influence people's behavior negatively. Visual media has not much high degree of regulation for dangerous sources, and has lower education sources. So children who doesn't build their own thinkings and self control might think that the visual media is right for our society, and act like what they saw in media. Some people say that visual media also has educational videos, books or others but children or other people's brain more likes media sources which signals to their dopamines. So people naturally contains to not educational videos. And watching visual medias in early ages is not good for children. Whether it is educational or not, they makes brain no to focus for bug time. Because of the flashing lights and short term changings of videos. Brains will be weaker to focus on one thing for long term. If this continues, children would not be able to read books of study for hours and talk with others. Visual media makes a lot of friends, memes, and other creations.

First, these trends are made and changed very fast. one trend of meme doesn't last for long periods. It makes disconnection between young people cannot. So they cannot talk with same topics. Also, in some elementery schools or children groups, there was a bullying between friend. They do not playing with friends who don't know about trends of memes and make them stay alone. I think visual media has positive dffects, but these effects can be gained by reading books of studying. And I think side effects are much more than positive effects.

Visual media does not have a high degree of regulation for harmful content and provides fewer educational resources. As a result, children who have not yet developed independent thinking and self-control may assume that what they see in visual media is acceptable in society and imitate those behaviors.

Some people argue that visual media also contains educational videos, books, or other useful resources. However, children’s and even adults’ brains tend to prefer media content that stimulates dopamine release. Consequently, people are naturally drawn away from educational content. Watching visual media from an early age is not beneficial for children. Whether the content is educational or not, it reduces their ability to focus for long periods because of flashing lights and rapid scene changes. Over time, the brain becomes weaker at concentrating on a single task. If this continues, children may lose the ability to read books or study for hours and may struggle to engage in meaningful conversations with others.

On the positive side, visual media allows people to make friends, share memes, and create new content. It connects people globally and provides entertainment for social interactions. However, in Korea these days, there are also negative side effects. Trends change very quickly, and memes do not last long. This creates disconnection among young people, since they cannot always share the same topics. In some elementary schools, bullying has occurred: children exclude peers who are unfamiliar with current memes, leaving them isolated.

Although visual media has positive effects, I believe these benefits can also be achieved through reading books or studying. In contrast, the negative effects seem to outweigh the positive ones. Therefore, I think visual media influences people’s behavior negatively.","Many people loves eating fast food because it is easy to get and tasty. Fast food has not much high degree of health regulation, and has lower nutrient sources. So people who doesn't care about diet and health might assume fast food is right for our body, and eat them a lot. Some people say that fast food is convenient and cheap, but people brain more likes foods which is sweet or salty. So people contains to eat unhealthy foods. And consuming fast foods in large amounts is not good for health. Whether it is cheap or not, it makes body gain more weight for long time. Because of the high calories and low nutrients. Body will be weaker to fight disease for long term. If this continues, people would not be able to do workouts of live healthy life. Fast food provides a lot of options, tastes, and variety. This makes people happy and offers joy for gathering with friends. But in America, recently, there are some consequences of thes. First, these foods are everywhere and cheap. one fast food advertisement doesn't last for long periods. It creates habit among young people can not stop. So they can not eat balanced diet. Also, in some communities or school groups, there was a increase in obesity rates. They do not caring about those who do not eat fast foods and they feel alone.

107449126627229098197,"    Now, I'll write my thought about the criteria of a good roommate. I spent Spring and Summer Semester in KAIST, and start fall semester few days ago. I'll demonstrate following statement based on these three different expirences. 
    Freshmen in KAIST belong to a group by randomly, I have good relationship in my group. But unfortunately, my dorm roommates were other group. Moreover, both are not close, so mood in our room was very awkward. I tried to be closer with 2 roommates, but I failed. Time flies, and I couldn't request my opinion because our relationship was so far that I can't even tell them anything. They turn on the light at very late night, do not tidy up, ear ramen in my room and even do not refresh air like opening window. It was very stressful. So, I think good roommate is a person who turn off the light at late night and bring standing ligth by ownselves, who tidy up room regularly and open the window if he eats something in my room.
    Next, I'll write about my Summer. In Summer, I could choose close friend. Also it was 2 men in 1 room. So, I was so happy because I thought I escape the hell. But, there was small problem. Everyday my friend ask me to play PC game and I play with him. It is good for a moment, but when I recall my Summer it is very regretful. I'm just thinking that I wasted my time. For this reason, good roommate is a person who give me positive effect to my life pattern.
    Lastly, in Fall semester, I get my roommates who are close with me. I was glad. But there is a problem. Because we are too close, they do not respect my time. I want to sleep, but they don't care about me and talking each other. So, good roommate is a person who respect my time although we are friend.
    To sum up, I write criteria of good roommate based on my experience. First, person who turn off the light at late night and bring own standing light. Second, person who tidy up room regularly. Third, person who open the door if he eats something. Fourth, person who help my life healthy and efficient. In last, person who respect my time.

In my high school, I started reading different kinds of books, and it changed my perspective a lot. I'll demonstrate following thoughts based on these different expirences. Sometimes, people say books are not necessary in modern world, but I disagree with that opinion. Reading is important because it enhance our knowledge, increases vocabulary and help to improve concentration. 

Firstly, books give us much information about world. They provide knowledge that can help us understand complex ideas and concepts. It is true that internet has lot information, but book provides a depth knowledge that online can't match. So, reading is a way to increase understanding about variety subjects. 

Secondly, the more we read, the more words we can add to our vocabulary. Reading allows us to see how words are used in context and it is a good way to learn new words. This is important because it help us to express ourselves better in both written and spoken language. 

Moreover, reading books require concentration, which is beneficial for our brain. When we read, we need to pay attention to understand story or information. It can be a challenge at first, but over time, it becomes easier to focus for longer periods. This can improve our ability to concentrate in other areas of life too. 

To sum up, I write the benefits of reading books based on my expirences. First, it gives us wide knowledge. Second, it increase our vocabulary. Third, it improve our concentration. From my point of view, these are the reasons why reading is important in our life. Thank you.","[{'description': 'Spelling or typo error', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': ""I'll demonstrate following thoughts based on these different <error>expirences</error>."", 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': ""but book <error>provides</error> a depth knowledge that online can't match."", 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Pronoun agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'This is important because <error>it</error> help us to express ourselves better in both written and spoken language.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'Firstly, books give us much information about <error>world</error>.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'Secondly, the more we read, the more words we can add to our <error>vocabulary</error>.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'This can improve our ability to concentrate <error>in</error> other areas of life too.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_007', 'evidence': 'Reading allows us to see how words are used in context and it <error>is</error> a good way to learn new words.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_008', 'evidence': 'To sum up, I write the benefits of reading books based on my <error>expirences</error>.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}]",1759317878019,mixed-uptake

I learned about nutrition in school last year, and explore more ideas a few days ago. I'll demonstrate this concepts from these two learning experiences. 
    Students in school have different diet plans by randomly, I have balanced my meals frequently. But unfortunately, some friends of mine eat too much junk food. Moreover, they is not aware, so health condition in their bodies become worse. I tried to inform them about this, but I failed. Time flies, and I couldn't request better meals because their habits was so far gone that I can't even tell them anything. They eat fast food at very late night, do not exercise, consume soda in large amounts and even do not drink enough water. It was very worrying. So, I think good diet is a plan which avoid late-night heavy meals and include opting for fruits and vegetables, drink water regularly, and return back to healthy habits gradually.
    Next, I'll discuss about my summer research. In summer, I could choose healthy recipes. Also, it was a delight for my family. So I was so eager because I thought I discovered new passion. But, there was minor setbacks. Everyday my brother ask me to make desserts and I oblige him. It is fun for a moment, but when I recall my summer it is very regretful. I'm just thinking that I ignored main meals. For this reason, good diet is a plan which emphasize healthy and balanced meals.
    Lastly, in winter break, I create plans with my family who are supportive. I was excited. But there is a challenge. Because we are together, they do not follow routine strictly. I want to stick to meals, but they decide to eat sweets and cookies. So, good diet is a plan which respect personal health goals although we are as a family.
    To sum up, I write about balanced diet based on my learning. First, plan which avoid late-night heavy meals. Second, plan which include fruits and vegetables regularly.

Some people says owning a pet is good for human health, but the others believe it could be stressful for both. I think having a pet could be good for life. Let discuss some reasons in my opinion.

First, having pets might improve human mood because pets often bring joy. This lead to happier families and healthier life. 

Second, people try to connect with animals emotional. Many pets give unconditional love, which is benefit for humans. In another words, people understand the love from a pet just like human connection.

Third, there are no proofs that owning a pet could be bad for health. Love from a pet is important, but too many pets may cause issues. Therefore, there is no clear line between pets and issues to human health.

There are several reasons why pets could be good. They often make people happy, connect emotional, and do not always cause health issues. Therefore, pets might be good for human life.","[{'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'Some people says owning a pet is good for human health, but the others believe it could be stressful for both.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Insufficient background information', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'Many pets give unconditional love, which is benefit for humans.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'No overall conclusion', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'Therefore, pets might be good for human life.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'organization'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': ""Pets are becoming a more important part of people's lives."", 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'Some people says owning a pet is good for human health.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}]",1759320121760,high-uptake

 First, if we work only 4 days in one week, there will be more work in one day. Suppose that you have work to do in one week. It is very easy to think that there will be more work to do in one day if you do this work only 4 days, not 5 days. This is not good for you and company, too.

In first way, you need to find resources such books and videos. In other way, an instructor will guide you step by steps. Consider learning without any guidance. Student would struggle and took long time, progress become slow. Yet, how do you even learn basics? I believe learning music has huge valuable impact on our personal growth.

Education is essential in our development and society. From this angle, music education has grown significantly. Nowadays courses are available in many platforms that we can choose without limitations, enhancing creativity, discipline, and memory.

Learning music also supports cognitive improvement. It can increase concentration and optimize brain functions. As example, when we play an instrument, we engage with various complex tasks like reading notes and rhythm. In time of exams, music skills be useful too. Relying only books have their limits to achieving success. With music, students remain calm and focus better.

Music gives relaxing atmosphere such as calming, peaceful sounds when stressed. In stressful moment, many minds were overwhelmed by anxiety and stress. But we can relieve ourselves now by following simple rhythmic exercises.

Playing is major part of learning music and life. Simply listening is not an active way to learn. So music education adds significant benefits to our lifestyle.","[{'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'There is two ways: self-teaching or taking lessons.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'Consider learning without any guidance.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'Student would struggle and took long time, progress become slow.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'Education is essential in our development and society.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Spelling or typo error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'From this angle, music education has grown significantly.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Weak or missing transitions', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'In time of exams, music skills be useful too.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'organization'}, {'description': 'Capitalization error', 'kc_id': 'kc_007', 'evidence': 'As example, when we play an instrument, we engage with various complex tasks like reading notes and rhythm.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Punctuation error', 'kc_id': 'kc_008', 'evidence': 'Relying only books have their limits to achieving success.

117559587884453217689,"I think visual media negatively influences people's behavior. Visual media does not have a high degree of regulation for harmful content and provides fewer educational resources. As a result, children who have not yet developed independent thinking and self-control may assume that what they see in visual media is acceptable in society and imitate those behaviors.

Some people argue that visual media also contains educational videos, books, or other useful resources. However, children’s and even adults’ brains tend to prefer media content that stimulates dopamine release. Consequently, people are naturally drawn away from educational content. Watching visual media from an early age is not beneficial for children. Whether the content is educational or not, it reduces their ability to focus for long periods because of flashing lights and rapid scene changes. Over time, the brain becomes weaker at concentrating on a single task. If this continues, children may lose the ability to read books or study for hours and may struggle to engage in meaningful conversations with others.

On the positive side, visual media allows people to make friends, share memes, and create new content. It connects people globally and provides entertainment for social interactions. However, in Korea these days, there are also negative side effects. Trends change very quickly, and memes do not last long.

Visual media does not have a high degree of regulation for harmful content and provides fewer educational resources. As a result, children who have not yet developed independent thinking and self-control may assume that what they see in visual media is acceptable in society and imitate those behaviors.

Some people argue that visual media also contains educational videos, books, or other useful resources. However, children’s and even adults’ brains tend to prefer media content that stimulates dopamine release. Consequently, people are naturally drawn away from educational content. Watching visual media from an early age is not beneficial for children. Whether the content is educational or not, it reduces their ability to focus for long periods because of flashing lights and rapid scene changes. Over time, the brain becomes weaker at concentrating on a single task. If this continues, children may lose the ability to read books or study for hours and may struggle to engage in meaningful conversations with others.

On the positive side, visual media allows people to make friends, share memes, and create new content. It connects people globally and provides entertainment for social interactions. However, in Korea these days, there are also negative side effects. Trends change very quickly, and memes do not last long. This creates disconnection among young people, since they cannot always share the same topics. In some elementary schools, bullying has occurred: children exclude peers who are unfamiliar with current memes, leaving them isolated.

Language learning can seem beneficial at first, providing access to different cultures and enhancing cognitive skills. Yet, it can come with challenges and misconceptions. Therefore, people may become frustrated with progress and feel less motivated.

While some advocate that learning a new language opens up career opportunities and improves communication with diverse populations. People also point out that the time investment is substantial. Additionally, not everyone has the environment to practice regularly, which makes the process less effective. Thus, it is difficult to achieve fluency without immersion.

At the same time, language education enables cultural exchanges and broadens understanding of worldviews. However, English, for instance, is often prioritized over other languages. In some contexts, it leads to cultural homogenization rather than valuing linguistic diversity. Moreover, focusing on English can create a gap between speakers of less common languages and those with global tongues.

Even though learning languages yields global awareness, it is essential to recognize the challenges along the way. The benefits of multilingualism are clear, but it is not without its difficulties. One needs genuine interest and the right resources to truly succeed.","[{'description': 'Lack of examples and details', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'Language learning can seem beneficial at first, providing access to different cultures and enhancing cognitive skills.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Missing thesis statement', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'Learning foreign languages has both positive and negative effects on people.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'organization'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'While some advocate that learning a new language opens up career opportunities and improves communication with diverse populations.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}]",1759320400249,high-uptake

However, it is not happy for me to hear that because I think that visual media influences people's behavior negatively. Why I think like that? Let me explain more.
First, I felt that visual media influences people's behavior negatively when I heard what my brother says like. When my brother was given his own phone, he spent more time watching Youtube. Then he said like Youtubers. His tone and words got rough, and he easily lost his anger while just normal dialog.

Second, visual media seeks profit, so it easily uses extreme action. For example, in Korean manner, it is not polite to eat noodle generating big sound. However, comedians eat noodle generating big sound to interest people and highlight how deliciously they could eat. After that, people more eat noodle with big sound.

Walking to office bring many benefits for peoples, so this trend is growing. However, some are not much enjoying this change because they think it is too long to walk. Why do they think like this? Let’s talk more.

Firstly, I noticed that walking to office benefits people health when observed my friend did so. When my friend started walking every morning, he was more energetic. He felt more healthy, and he no longer got bored while on the way. Comparing before when he took the bus, I found that walking is better. Moreover, given that many are said to lack exercise, walking is likely must help it positively.

Secondly, walking is more environmentally friendly because it uses no fuel. For instance, cars emit gases that could harm the air, but walking does not. People who walk contribute to cleaner environment. Hence, I think walking spread good habits.

Lastly, more we engage in walking, much we reduce stress. We become more calm, make fewer mistakes, think more positively. It impacts the mind in ways that production enhances. I have seen positive results from walking to office, and I described them earlier. Overall, walking's influence is beneficial, so effort to encourage it should be made.","[{'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'Why do they think like this?', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'No overall conclusion', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': ""Overall, walking's influence is beneficial, so effort to encourage it should be made."", 'priority': 4, 'category': 'organization'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'Walking to office bring many benefits for <error>peoples</error>', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'walking to office <error>bring</error> many benefits', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Punctuation error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'he felt more healthy, and he no longer got bored while on the way', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'walking is likely <error>must</error> help it positively', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_007', 'evidence': 'when <error>observed</error> my friend did so', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Run-on sentence error', 'kc_id': 'kc_008', 'evidence': 'comparing before when he took the bus, I found that walking is better', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_009', 'evidence': 'impacts <error>the</error> mind in ways that production enhances', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}]",1759321468317,low-uptake

    Freshmen in KAIST belong to a group by randomly, I have good relationship in my group. But unfortunately, my dorm roommates were other group. Moreover, both are not close, so mood in our room was very awkward. I tried to be closer with 2 roommates, but I failed. Time flies, and I couldn't request my opinion because our relationship was so far that I can't even tell them anything. They turn on the light at very late night, do not tidy up, ear ramen in my room and even do not refresh air like opening window. It was very stressful. So, I think good roommate is a person who turn off the light at late night and bring standing light by ourselves, who tidy up room regularly and open the window if he eats something in my room.
    Next, I'll write about my Summer. In Summer, I could choose close friend. Also it was 2 men in 1 room. So, I was so happy because I thought I escape the hell. But, there was small problem. Everyday my friend ask me to play PC game and I play with him. It is good for a moment, but when I recall my Summer it is very regretful. I'm just thinking that I wasted my time. For this reason, good roommate is a person who give me positive effect to my life pattern.
    Lastly, in Fall semester, I get my roommates who are close with me. I was glad. But there is a problem. Because we are too close, they do not respect my time. I want to sleep, but they don't care about me and talking each other. So, good roommate is a person who respect my time although we are friend.

I'll describe my opinion based on these two different experiences. 

    Students in the school are assigned to classes randomly, and I have had good teachers. But, unfortunately, my math teacher was not very helpful. Moreover, both of us did not communicate, so the atmosphere in class was uncomfortable. I tried to ask questions, but I did not understand. Time fly, and I didn't have the chance to share my thoughts because the relationship was too distant and I can’t ask anything. They explain topics very briefly, do not provide examples, give tests too frequently and do not use interesting materials. It was very difficult. So, I think a great teacher is someone who explains well, use examples, provide clear homework, and finds ways to make the class interesting.

    Next, I'll write about my university experience. At university, we have more freedom to choose professors. I was hopeful because I could select who I wanted to learn from. But there are big problems. Everyday we have long lectures and I struggle to keep focus. It’s fine for a while, but when reflecting on my day, it is exhausting. Therefore, a great teacher understands students' capacity and makes learning comfortable. 

    Lastly, my favorite subject is history and I appreciate my professor. We have classes twice a week and it’s fascinating, however, it can still get hard. Because of deep topics, discussions are intense and require much from us. So, a great teacher balances challenge with engagement, even if the subject is tough.

    To conclude, I wrote about what makes a teacher great from my perspective. First, someone who clearly explains topics. Second, someone who provides engaging material. Third, someone who is considerate of student capacity. Fourth, someone who manages class discussions well. Lastly, someone who knows how to balance challenge and ease. These are my ideas of a great teacher.

Without water, it is easy to get dehydrated, especially if the weather is hot. Dehydration can cause serious health problem, so always have a steady supply. Second, don’t forget map. You cannot rely only on mobile devices which can lose battery or signal. A paper map is reliable and will guide you through paths. It is easy to forgot the way, and you might get lost if there is no map. It ensures your safety and makes sure you can return home safely.

Visual media does not have a high degree of regulation for harmful content and provides fewer educational resources. As a result, children who have not yet developed independent thinking and self-control may assume that what they see in visual media is acceptable in society and imitate those behaviors.

Some people argue that visual media also contains educational videos, books, or other useful resources. However, children’s and even adults’ brains tend to prefer media content that stimulates dopamine release. Consequently, people are naturally drawn away from educational content. Watching visual media from an early age is not beneficial for children. Whether the content is educational or not, it reduces their ability to focus for long periods because of flashing lights and rapid scene changes. Over time, the brain becomes weaker at concentrating on a single task. If this continues, children may lose the ability to read books or study for hours and may struggle to engage in meaningful conversations with others.

On the positive side, visual media allows people to make friends, share memes, and create new content. It connects people globally and provides entertainment for social interactions. However, in Korea these days, there are also negative side effects. Trends change very quickly, and memes do not last long. This creates disconnection among young people, since they cannot always share the same topics. In some elementary schools, bullying has occurred: children exclude peers who are unfamiliar with current memes, leaving them isolated.

Although visual media has positive effects, I believe these benefits can also be achieved through reading books or studying. In contrast, the negative effects seem to outweigh the positive ones. Therefore, I think visual media influences people’s behavior negatively.","I believe social media affects people's lifestyles in bad way. Social media have not much strong rules against harmful content, and has lower value contents.

Some says social media also provide beneficial posts, articles or others but youngsters or adult's brain more prefer media sources which triggers to their dopamines. So individuals naturally concentrates to not informative contents. And using social medias from young age is not beneficial for kids. Whether it is beneficial or not, they do brain not to concentrate for longer moments. Because of the constant notifications and quick shifts of contents. Minds will get less able to concentrate on one task for long time. If this carries on, kids would not be capable to read papers of study for long time and chat with others. Social media creates communities, games, and other interactions. This engage people in wider context and offers joy for chatting with friends. But in Korea, these periods, there some adverse outcomes of those. First, these crazes are made and changed too quick. one craze of content doesn't continue for extensive durations. It causes gap between young individuals cannot. So they cannot discuss about same subject. Also, in some schools or teen groups, there is exclusion between friends. They do not engaging with peers who don't know about crazes of contents and make them stay alone.

Education is becoming crucial in our world and locally. In this perspection, internet has evolved greatly.

For instance, when learning guitar, you can order guitar books, accessories, etc. and follow video tutorials. In case of safety, internet is useful as well. Physical books are limited in data and interactivity. But now, with the internet, we can access interactive learning tools. A music student can perform on virtual stage neatly using a reliable connection.

Having internet access gives us safe learning spaces like home and library. In past, many learners struggling due to limited resources or guidance. But in modern days, anyone can pursue education at such situations by using online resources.

Learning is key part of growth and human progress. Reading books and attending in-person class are less efficient ways to educate.

Definitely you will call to 119 if you are in an accident. Because of the automobile's utility, you can save your home and valuable things. I'm not saying that automobile doesn't have problems. Just I want to say that automobile have a lot of advantage more than disadvantage in modern life. In recent days, only 5 min for helped by police or ambulance. If you get a heart attack? Automobile will save you.
What if we inhibit automobile because of the social problems. I can surely say that our society, economy and government will collapse. In modern life, everyone get a specialize job and can't live alone. Because of that reason, we cannot live with automobiles help. We have no food in the city, and farmer have no product from factories.","Modern technology bring a lot of changes. Mobile phone is invented a long time ago, and it have changed world completely since then. Mobile phone cause some issues, like addiction and distraction when driving. I agree those issues serious but new solutions can be found. Mobile phones improve modern life greatly because of their utility.

Before mobile phone, sending message took many days. For instance, in ancient texts took months to arrive. But now on, message can be sent instantly with mobile phones. This improves communication and lead to economically and socially improvements. We can say those phones impact modern society greatly.

If you are in accident, you will call to 911. Thanks to mobile phone, help can be on the way fast. I'm not saying mobile phone is perfect. Just I want to say mobile phone offer a lot of advantage even with issues. Now, only few minutes before help come from police or ambulance. If emergency happen, mobile phone help save life.

What if we banned mobile phone because of problem they cause? Society will collapse, economy slowdown. In modern world, everyone specialize in job and for that reason, not possible live without mobile phone assistance. Without help of technology, many tasks become impossible.","[{'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'Mobile phone is invented a long time ago, and it <error>have</error> changed world completely since then.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'Mobile phone <error>cause</error> some issues, like addiction and distraction when driving.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Comma splice error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'But now on, message can be sent instantly with mobile phones.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Spelling or typo error', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'For instance, in <error>ancient</error> texts took months to arrive.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Misspelling error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'This improves communication and lead to economically and socially <error>improvements</error>.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'We can say those phones impact modern society greatly.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Punctuation error', 'kc_id': 'kc_007', 'evidence': 'If you are in accident, you will call <error>to</error> 911.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Run-on sentence error', 'kc_id': 'kc_008', 'evidence': 'Thanks to mobile phone, help can be on the way fast.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_009', 'evidence': 'Just I want to say mobile phone offer a lot of advantage even with issues.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Run-on sentence error', 'kc_id': 'kc_010', 'evidence': 'Now, only few minutes before help come from police or ambulance.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Missing thesis statement', 'kc_id': 'kc_011', 'evidence': 'In modern world, everyone specialize in job and for that reason, not possible live without mobile phone assistance.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'organization'}]",1759323925001,mixed-uptake

According to research, if bio time is broken, expect life decreases. Therefore, we have to be respect bio time of our roommate. But each people have various bio time. When you talk with your friends, somebody is sleeping. So we should be quiet to be respect bio time of our roommate.
 Second, be clear. When I was 17, in high school, I had dirty roommate. He didn't take showers, threw food waste on the floor. Our room became  messier and messier, and eventually we did't have enough space to do something and smell like garbage can. This was the worst experience in my life. After this experience, I realize cleanliness is very important. So I think when we live with someone, we should keep our room clean.

Depending on where you go, your experience can be exciting or disappointing. Then, what are the reasons that people want to travel abroad. I think there are three reasons why people travel abroad. First, exploring different cultures. Do you know about different traditions? Culture is way of life, including food, music, and clothes. It is important to learn about others. According to research, if culture understanding is increased, international relations become good. Therefore, we have to experience different traditions of country. But each country have own unique culture. When you visit new place, you may feel surprised. So you should be open-minded to learn from new culture. Second, to see famous landmarks. When I was 20, I visited Paris. I saw Eiffel Tower and Louvre Museum. It was amazing seeing these landmarks, and made memories I never forget. This was one of best experiences in my life. After this trip, I realized sightseeing is very rewarding. So I think when we travel, we should visit famous places. Lastly, to try new foods. Even though some people may be picky eaters, trying new foods is exciting. If we can't be open to try new foods, we miss experiences. Trying foods is one of the most enjoyable parts of travel. It can be delicious, and help bond with locals. So we should be open to try new cuisines.

  Firstly, 2 days are very short and unbalanced. We work 5 days and rest 2 days, then it can't give perfect rest for us. If we aren't take a rest efficient, we can't work efficient, also. That is not good for all of us.
  Secondly, we need to time for self-training. We do not only work but also self-training. For example, we can spend time for learning about programming, singing or writing some books, etc. These times make your skills develop and raise your work efficiency.
  Lastly, we don't need to work harder than before. AI can do many simple works faster than people. So, we don't need to work long time. We have to concentrate our own work and have to think what should we do and what AI can't do. We train our mind and have creativity more than before.

It is because holidays are really shorter than weekdays. In a week, we have 5 days for a work and 2 days for a rest. Then, I think that there should be a 4-day work week. There are three reasons.
  First, 2 days are very short and unbalanced. We work 5 days and rest 2 days, then it can't give perfect rest for us. If we aren't take a rest efficiently, we can't work well, also. That is not good for all of us.
  Second, we need to time for self-training. We do not only work. For example, we can spend time for learning about programming, singing or writing some books, etc. These times make your skills develop and raise your work efficiency.
  Last, we don't need to work harder than before. AI can do many simple works faster than people. So, we don't need to work long time. We have to concentrate our own work and have to think what should we do and what AI can't do. We train our mind and have creativity more than before.

In contrast, New York city has developed gradually which makes city organized. I also experienced a tip culture and at Smithsonian museum, I watched many sculpture of organisms that I had learned about during evolution and taxonomy class. So studying abroad helps you to get a new experience.

Second, you can have a relationship with new people. Relationship is important because when you get in trouble, you can receive a support and encouragement from your people. For instance, when you do a business, a relationship with employers, other companies are necessary to keep your business stable. So more various people you meet, more abundant your life.

Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter keep us in touch with friends and family around the globe, with a just few clicks. However, not everyone has develop skills to use these responsibly, which can lead to problems. I suspect that social media may contribute negatively to personal relationships, a point that I will discuss more in detail soon. 

Firstly, people need to be capable of understanding how online interaction compares to real life. Often, these platforms present an idealised version of life, involving perfect photos and lifestyles that could conflict with their personal views. For example, Instagram influencers might portray their daily routines in way that many individuals try to mimic without consideration of their own situations, believing ""This is the way I should live!"". This does not suggest we need to ban these platforms as they provide entertainment and information, but younger audiences who see these posts might be easily influenced and misguided by idealised standards. 

Additionally, seeing through what is genuine or fake on social platforms requires critical thinking abilities. For instance, Twitter often becomes a place where misinformation spreads swiftly due to the ability of anyone to share any tweet they want, even if they are not true, leading to confusion among users.

Finally, with the chronic presence of social media every moment, some people might lose track of the time and neglect real world responsibilities, becoming entangled with endless scrolling, memes, and likes, which can reduce their overall effectiveness and focus on important tasks, thus lowering productivity. 

To sum up, various negative effects could impact an individual's perspectives if social platform messages are taken at face value. Nevertheless, well-grounded and mature mind could handle them appropriately.","[{'description': 'Insufficient background information', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter keep us in touch with friends and family around the globe, with a just few clicks.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Missing thesis statement', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'I suspect that social media may contribute negatively to personal relationships, a point that I will discuss more in detail soon.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'organization'}, {'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'For example, Instagram influencers might portray their daily routines in way that many individuals try to mimic without consideration of their own situations, believing ""This is the way I should live!"".', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Missing concluding sentences', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'This does not suggest we need to ban these platforms as they provide entertainment and information, but younger audiences who see these posts might be easily influenced and misguided by idealised standards.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'organization'}, {'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'For instance, Twitter often becomes a place where misinformation spreads swiftly due to the ability of anyone to share any tweet they want, even if they are not true, leading to confusion among users.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Comma splice error', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'Finally, with the chronic presence of social media every moment, some people might lose track of the time and neglect real world responsibilities, becoming entangled with endless scrolling, memes, and likes, which can reduce their overall effectiveness and focus on important tasks, thus lowering productivity.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'No overall conclusion', 'kc_id': 'kc_007', 'evidence': ""To sum up, various negative effects could impact an individual's perspectives if social platform messages are taken at face value."", 'priority': 4, 'category': 'organization'}]",1759324429686,high-uptake

 Nowadays the most of people use visual media to spend their time. Some people says visual media is just a blackhole that eats our valuable time. However, visual media has a very important role for our life.
 First of all, watching visual media is not a waste of time. We can learn many things from visual media. For example, we can learn Korea's financial history from Jaebulgipmaknaeadeul which is a Korean drama, and also different common sences fom Youtube. I knew that if I turn on the fan while I'm sleeping, I die, but I realized that is just a fake. For these reasons, we can learn many things through the visual medias.

 Nowadays the most of people use visual media to spend their time. Some people says visual media is just a blackhole that eats our valuable time. However, visual media has a very important role to our life.
 First of all, watching visual media is not a waste of time. We can learn many things from visual media. For example, we can learn Korea's financial history from Jaebulgipmaknaeadeul which is a Korean drama, and also different common sences fom Youtube. I knew that if I turn on the fan while I'm sleeping, I die, but I realized that is just a fake. For these reasons, we can learn many things through the visual medias.

 In the modern days, the most of people underestimate the value of rest. Some people think rest means sitting lazily and doing nothing. However, rest is needed part of our lives.
 First of all, rest helps to recharge the human energy. We can feel more energetic after a short nap. For example, by taking a walk in the park, which helps us relax, and also taking deep breaths from nature. I believed that if I rest too much, I become lazy, but then I learned that is not true. Therefore, rest is very beneficial to our bodies minds.
 Next, rest allows us to reflect on own life. Without proper rest, we keep running and miss many important life moments. Without a break, we reduce our ability to solve the problems, and we cannot handle stress effectively. We gain many insights from resting and can incorporate them into our future plans.
 Finally, rest brings us joy and happiness. For instance, tired people may listen to music, and fulfill their empty souls or by stopping work, we can release tension, and become refreshed for next tasks. We can get a mental recharge from resting!
 To conclude, rest is not merely being idle, but a refresh button, inspiration spark, and mood enhancer of our days. Even though we sometimes see it as waste, the true benefits within rest are invaluable. We should embrace rest in our lives.","[{'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'In the modern days, the most of people underestimate the value of rest.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'Some people <error>think</error> rest means sitting lazily and doing nothing.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Spelling or typo error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'First of all, rest helps to recharge the human <error>energy</error>.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Spelling or typo error', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'We can feel more energetic after a short <error>nap</error>.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'Therefore, rest is very beneficial to our <error>bodies</error> minds.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'Finally, rest brings us joy and happiness.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Spelling or typo error', 'kc_id': 'kc_007', 'evidence': 'We gain many insights from resting and can incorporate them into our future <error>plans</error>.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_008', 'evidence': 'Even though we sometimes see it as waste, the true benefits within rest are invaluable.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}]",1759324460456,low-uptake

Second, visual media seeks profit, so it easily uses extreme action. For example, in Korean manner, it is not polite to eat noodle generating big sound. However, comedians eat noodle generating big sound to interest people and highlight how deliciously they could eat. After that, people more eat noodle with big sound. So, I think visual media spread impolite manners.

Air pollution is having big impacts on health, so the government's actions may affects people's lives. However, it is not enough to simply blame them because we think that pollution has many sources. How we think about it? Let us discuss more.
The first problem is that factories release harmful gases into the air. I thinks that these emissions are dangerous when I see the smoke factories releases. The sky becomes gray, and it feels unhealthy to breathe when close to factories. Compare to time before industrialization, I found that air quality was cleaner. In addition, given that cities are said to contribute heavily to pollution, industrial activity is likely to have to do with decreasing air quality.
Second, vehicles run on fuels that cause pollution, so people prefer them for convenience. For example, in many places, it is considered efficient to use cars even for short distances. However, more people prefer public transport, pollution isn't reduced fast.
Lastly, as we progress technologically, pollution more easily become a bigger issue. Then, controlling it is complex, easily causes debates, more needs solutions. It can affect global climate change which impacts many regions negatively. I observed pollution issues before, and I explained some of these problems earlier.

Second, the size of import and export would very smaller without the automobile. In modern life, we can eat beef from U.S. and coffee roasted with coffee bean in Africa. Without automobile, all we eat would be restricted and become more expensive. With import and export, countries could grow up by developing what they can make well and exchanging it.
Third, trip to other cities or countries would become impossible. If we don't have automobiles, we should spend at least 10 day to go to Busan from Daejeon. Furthermore, we can't even go China because of North Korea. Someone might think it is not necessary but for some cities, trip is most earning parts among any other industries.
Automobile have some serious problems. Earth pollution, used in war, and some like that. However, we cannot even live 'modern life' without the automobile. We should find solutions for automobile's problems, not arguing we have to prohibit automobiles.
The automobile has obviously improved countries, cities and individuals so far.","Title: The influence of technology on daily communication
In recent years, I talked many countries using advanced technology. The smartphone is crucial, but it let me communicate with people in different time zones. Technology is one of most significant developments. We utilize phones, computers, internet, email, and social media. We frequently use it to stay in touch with family, conduct business, or share information. But how would it be like if all technology suddenly cease to exist?
First, our personal lives would become more isolated. We cannot easily connect like before, and gaining new friends online become nearly unattainable. It is important because we keeps contact with friends internationally now. For example, conversation from several individual can only take place few times a year due to old fashion letters. It might hinder progress in building relationships.
Second, the availability of information would be drastic reduced without the technology. Nowadays, we access news globally and learn things occurring anywhere instantly. Without technology, our knowledge would limited and news delayed. People could not develop quickly and adapting to changes will face obstacles.
Third, reaching out to anyone or making emergency calls would become problematic. If we lack technology, alert others in emergencies would take hours instead of seconds. People might think it is unnecessary, but in some situations, timely responses are essential to saving lives.
Technology poses challenges, environment harm, misuse, and similar problems. However, we can't fully enjoy 'new era' without it. We need to resolve technology issues, not banish its progress.
Technology has evidently enhance personal and global connections so far.","[{'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'But how would it be like if all technology suddenly cease to exist?', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Weak or missing transitions', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'Third, reaching out to anyone or making emergency calls would become problematic.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'organization'}, {'description': 'Spelling or typo error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'In recent years, I talked <error>many</error> countries using advanced technology.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'Technology is <error>one</error> of most significant developments.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_008', 'evidence': 'But how would it be like if all technology suddenly <error>cease</error> to exist?', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_009', 'evidence': 'It is important because we <error>keeps</error> contact with friends internationally now.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Pronoun agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_010', 'evidence': 'We frequently use <error>it</error> to stay in touch with family, conduct business, or share information.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_011', 'evidence': 'We cannot easily connect like before, and gaining new friends online <error>become</error> nearly unattainable.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Spelling or typo error', 'kc_id': 'kc_011', 'evidence': 'For example, conversation from several <error>individual</error> can only take place few times a year due to old fashion letters.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_012', 'evidence': 'People could not develop quickly and adapting to changes <error>will</error> face obstacles.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_013', 'evidence': 'Technology <error>has</error> evidently enhance personal and global connections so far.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Punctuation error', 'kc_id': 'kc_014', 'evidence': 'Technology poses challenges, environment harm, misuse, and <error>similar problems.</error>', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}]",1759324912351,high-uptake

 Regular physical exercise is crucial for maintaining good health. Some doctors suggests that it is the most effective way to prevent illnesses. However, physical exercise can offer many other benefits to our well-being.
 First, doing physical exercise is not a waste of energy. We can improve several aspects of our health from different kinds of exercises. For example, jogging can enhance heart health and swimming can strengthen muscles. I used to think that any exercise after evening will hurt sleep, but I discovered that it is not true. For these reasons, we can gain many benefits through the physical exercise.
 Next, physical activity helps us connect with others. Without the experience of teamwork in sports, we can understand and feel cooperation by playing games. Without the experience of a competition, we can understand the thrill of winning, and will want to strive for success. We acquire new perspectives from physical activities and we can apply them in everyday life.
 Finally, through physical exercise, we can manage our emotions. For example, lonely people can join group activities, filling their lack of companionship, or by engaging in yoga, we can relax our mind and find peace. We get a good mental boost from physical exercise!
 To end, physical exercise is not just efforts and sweat, but a way to enrich our lives. This is simply a form of self-care. Despite any form, the truth inside it remains constant.

Today, learning languages are very important for modern people. Everyone should learn at least one language aside from their mother tongue. People use language not just for communication or writing letters. They require it for reading books, traveling abroad, or doing business internationally. Although it is difficult, people learns new language quickly these days. As more people engage in language studies, numerous benefits arise. Cultural exchange, new friendships, and better job opportunities is among the most exciting prospects. However, I believe learning languages has more advantages than it seems. Therefore pursuing language education should be encouraged further.

It appears like language learning takes a lot of effort. This is because learning a new language can be challenging and require a lot of time. Even though it takes much dedication, it make communication easier globally. Bilinguals and polyglots communicate effectively across different countries, proving beneficial for diplomacy and global trade. Speaking multiple languages promotes understanding across cultures and enhances personal growth. Additionally, multi-language capabilities open doors to education from institutions worldwide, making knowledge accessible and life richer.

Next, we should continue to encourage language studies, even if it requires effort and time investment. As mentioned in the second paragraph, learning languages has not only challenges but also offers numerous personal benefits. It is real that mastering a new language may take years. However, if we give up we cannot enjoy these benefits. Although there are sacrifices needed, we should push forward to gain greater understanding of the world. Preparing our future generations with language skills is crucial for a brighter future.

Given how learning languages has enriched our lives, it is clear that stopping is not an option. Subsequently, we should persist in language study so it becomes increasingly beneficial. This drive towards multilingualism is our best plan for a diverse and inclusive future.","[{'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'People use language not just for communication or writing letters.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'Although it is difficult, people <error>learns</error> new language quickly these days.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Lack of examples and details', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'Cultural exchange, new friendships, and better job opportunities is among the most exciting prospects.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Missing thesis statement', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'However, I believe learning languages has more advantages than it seems.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'organization'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'Even though it takes much dedication, it <error>make</error> communication easier globally.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Weak or missing transitions', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'Additionally, multi-language capabilities open doors to education from institutions worldwide, making knowledge accessible and life richer.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'organization'}, {'description': 'No overall conclusion', 'kc_id': 'kc_007', 'evidence': 'This drive towards multilingualism is our best plan for a diverse and inclusive future.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'organization'}]",1759406893746,high-uptake

Devices like smartphones and laptops keep us connected and helps us be productive. But is all of this technology really necessary? Some argue that we should limit technology use to regain more personal time and focus on family. This notion could sound ideal to many people, since spending all day on devices may lead to less time with loved ones. On contrary, changing the way we use technology abruptly can have negative consequences. What kind of problems might this cause?
It would indeed lead to setbacks in communication habits. We are accustomed to connect through digital platforms. Most people believe that technology advancements improved our lives significantly and societies pursue such digital growth. Yet, imagine if we started restricting technology usage significantly, how businesses communication will suffer. The first problem is that engaging with clients and partners will become more difficult. Without real-time communication tools, productivity could decrease.

First reason that I disagree is if there is 4-day work week, we need more work on week. When 5-day work week changes 4-day work week, if we work same amount, result amount will decrease. So, we work more harder to fill decreased amount and this will lead to harder work in work week.

Second reason is we already have much time to spend our hobby time. Some people who agree 4-day work week argue that if we change work week, we spend enough time to enjoy hobby. But I think we already have enough time to spend our hobby time. Because when we rest on weekend, we consume enough time to exercise, watch movie, and so on. Moreover, we also have free time on work week when we finish the work.

So for the recent few centuries, uses of automobile heat the Earth and cause many serious nature issues. But it can be solved with development of electric vehicles. In addition to this, I want to emphasize that the use of automobile is not major causes of greenhouse effect anymore.

After the industrial revolution at 18th century, human has been able to manufacture almost everything with great amount. This decreases the price of each thing, so individual can buy car, foods and house. With the technique of manufacturing, we can make, for example, 1000000 water bottles in factory. But to distribute these manufactured bottles to individuals, we need transporting element. Since the automobile is the major part of transportation, without this, the human civilization can not maintain itself.","Imagine if the internet suddenly disappears from our daily life. What will happen to us? After few hours, you may notice you cannot check emails or social media. In this case, it is not an urgent problem. But after few days, you may struggle to access important information and communication may become harder. This example shows internet is very essential for our daily life. So I want to emphasize internet is totally beneficial for human's interaction.

Life is difficult without internet, but it has some harmful aspect. Most of recently internet servers require a lot of energy which make pollution and increase carbon footprint. So for the last few years, usage of internet consume more resources and cause environmental problems. However, it is solved by development of renewable energy sources. In addition to this, I would like to say that the usage of internet is not significant cause of pollution anymore.

After the technology boom in 20th century, people have developed faster access to knowledge. This lowers the barrier to education, so individuals can gain skills, jobs, and entertain. With the internet tool, we can send, for example, thousands of messages every second. But to make this vast network function, we need powerful servers. Since the internet is the key part of modern communication, without it, our society cannot sustain its current pace.","[{'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': ""So I want to emphasize internet is totally beneficial for human's interaction."", 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'After <error>few</error> hours, you may notice you cannot check emails or social media.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'In this case, it is not <error>an</error> urgent problem.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'But after <error>few</error> days, you may struggle to access important information and communication may become harder.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'So for the last few years, usage of internet <error>consume</error> more resources and cause environmental problems.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'After the technology boom in <error>20th</error> century, people have developed faster access to knowledge.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_007', 'evidence': 'After the technology boom in 20th century, people <error>have</error> developed faster access to knowledge.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_008', 'evidence': 'This lowers the barrier to education, so individuals can gain skills, jobs, and <error>entertain</error>.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Run-on sentence error', 'kc_id': 'kc_009', 'evidence': 'With the internet tool, we can send, for example, thousands of messages every second.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}]",1759579445511,

Water is one of the most important resource in our daily life. Imagine if we wake up tomorrow, and there was no water anywhere. Everyone understand that water is essential to live, but many people forgets about this fact and waste water unnecessarily. In a different situation, there was an earthquake that cause people to worry about water supply. Many people stored the water ahead of time and it became scarce for others. However, I think we must use water wisely for several important reasons.
 First, water conservation help us save money. If people pays attention to their water usage, their water bills can be reduced. People does not think about how much money they lose by leaving a tap running. Saving money is important for everyone.
 Second, water conservation helps to protect our environment. By reducing our usage, we decrease the demand for water resources; this is beneficial for nature. When we need less water, water systems are less stressed and keeps the balance of nature. For example, fewer water usage means less energy needed to pump water to homes.
 Finally, the future of our planet depends on good use of water. Freshwater reserves are limited and they can gone soon if we don't act now. Just like a fire can be put out without using an extinguisher. We must take action before it is too late and save water for future generations. Water is crucial for daily life.
 For these reasons, water conservation helps save money, protects the environment, and is vital for the future. We should not ignore this and use water wisely.","[{'description': 'Irrelevant information included', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'In a different situation, there was an earthquake that cause people to worry about water supply.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'Everyone <error>understand</error> that water is essential to live.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'Water is one of <error>the</error> most important resource in our daily life.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Insufficient background information', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'By reducing our usage, we decrease the demand for water resources; this is beneficial for nature.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Comma splice error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': 'Just like a fire can be put out without using an extinguisher.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Punctuation error', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'We must take action before it is too late and save water for future generations.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}]",1759484010895,low-uptake

However, it is not happy for me to hear that because I think that visual media influences people's behavior negatively. Why I think like that? Let me explain more.
First, I felt that visual media influences people's behavior negatively when I heard the way my brother said. When my brother was given his own phone, he spent more time watching Youtube. Then he said like Youtubers. His tone and words got rough, and he easily lost his anger during just normal dialog. Comparing the time when he said more softly, I found that the difference was the length of time he watched Youtube. In addition, given that teenagers are said not to be able to communicate well, visual media is likely to has to do with negative behavior.
Second, since visual media seeks profit, it easily uses extreme action. For example, in Korean manner, it is considered not polite to eat noodle generating big sound. However, comedians ate noodle generating big sound to interest people and highlighted how deliciously they could eat. After that, people more ate noodle with big sound. So, I think visual media spread impolite manners.
Third, as we spend more time watching visual media, our brain more easily get tired. Then we cannot focus on our main work, easily make mistakes, more think negatively. It can influence the region of brain which controls behavior and other except visual sense, negatively.

Healthy foods has many vitamins, so the chance of getting ill may decreases. However, it is not easy to know what exactly to eat because I think that not all healthy foods are tasty.

After time, we might have to use papers to write or check books for information. In this moment, it is not big trouble. But after several weeks, access to digital content and communication will become impossible, and this problem will make life more difficult. This shows us clearly that computers are very essential to our modern life. So what I want to share is that computers play very good role in our daily life.

We can't imagine life without computer, but it also comes with some bad sides. Many current computers consume electricity which contributes to environmental damage. So in recent decades, the widespread use of computers has increased power demands and environmental problems. But these challenges can be tackled with renewable energy sources. Moreover, I want to underline that computers are not main reason of energy crisis now.

Since the digital age began, people have the ability to process huge amounts of information rapidly. This advancement lowered the cost of information, so anyone can access media, online courses and virtual goods. With technological advancement, we can produce, for example, millions of digital documents instantly. But to manage and spread these digital contents, we need a robust internet infrastructure.

  First, 2 days are very short and unbalanced. We work 5 days and rest 2 days, then it can't give perfect rest for us. If we aren't take a rest efficiently, we can't work well, also. That is not good for all of us.
  Second, we need to time for self-training. We do not only work. For example, we can spend time for learning about programming, singing or writing some books, etc. These times make your skills develop and raise your work efficiency.
  Last, we don't need to work harder than before. AI can do many simple works faster than people. So, we don't need to work long time. We have to concentrate our own work and have to think what should we do and what AI can't do. We train our mind and have creativity more than before.
  In conclusion, for these three reasons, I think that we need 4-day work week.

With this change, students and readers would use e-readers or tablets instead of traditional books; or, they might could have the choice to select which material they prefer between digital and physical copies. This big trend has came from major publishers and educational institutes in different parts of Europe, aiming to reduce paper use and increase access to books and materials for each individuals. The main factor driving this interest in Japan is the statement by the current Education Minister, Yuki Nakamura, about initiating his plans for reorganizing educational resources this fiscal year.

He stated that during his term, he will implement a transition to digital books on a large scale and will introduced a mixed system — both digital and paper books will be available, but with a premium on paper copies. The core argument was maintaining the essence of reading, which has been questioned and challenged by several educators and scientists.

Yet nonetheless, I believe it is not only about choosing between paper and digital books. Personally, the focus should be on enhancing reading experiences, adjusted based on individual learner's needs, and this flexibility should be provided to stakeholders within defined limits.

Here's a primary reason: optimal reading methods largely depends on personal preferences. Student populations, that still comprise a large percentage of national demographic, benefit from accessing diverse formats for learning and comprehension. Both paper and digital options could serve well for different learners.

Now let's think about how would we make the long marathon to our hometown if we didn't have all these automobiles. We might have to walk all the way down, which would take more than a week, for sure. As you can see, the automobile has improved our life a lot. I will show you some more examples throughout this passage. 

 Back in the days, when there was some important news in the country, it tooke a lot of times to get people know it since the country was too big to move around just with a horse or something. After the automobile came out, it became much easier to send recent news across the country. The best improvement that the automobile made is that we could save a lot of times.

 The automobile made our society way better, too. The shorter time taken to move means more chances to meet friends who lives in the opposite side of the country and more time for work or entertainment. This improved the social activity in human society and also the quality of human's life.

Everyone, like me, will be getting ready for the big event: Preparing all familys members, buy materials for making delicious foods, or maybe finding new clothes to wear. Now let's imagine how it would be if we didn't have all these modern stores. We might have to grow all foods ourselves, which would takes a lot of time for sure. As you observe, supermarkets has made our life simpler. I will tells you more reasons in this passage. 

In past times, when there was some big celebration upcoming, it tooked so much effort to make everything from scratch as there was no local stores. After supermarkets appeared, it got easier to gather all needs without hassle. The best improvement made by supermarkets is that we could save many times. 

Supermarkets made community better, too. The less time taken to gather supplies means more time to spend with family who lives far away or more time for rest and joy. This has enriched the communal activities in societies and has also enhanced quality of a human's life.

In conclusion, supermarkets have definitely improved our daily life and community. We should always be thankful towards supermarkets.","[{'description': 'Unclear or vague ideas', 'kc_id': 'kc_001', 'evidence': 'The ""Spring Festivel"" is just around the corner.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'content'}, {'description': 'Verb tense error', 'kc_id': 'kc_002', 'evidence': 'Everyone, like me, will be getting ready for the big event: Preparing all familys members, <error>buy</error> materials for making delicious foods, or maybe finding new clothes to wear.', 'priority': 3, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Subject verb agreement error', 'kc_id': 'kc_003', 'evidence': 'We might have to grow all foods ourselves, which would <error>takes</error> a lot of time for sure.', 'priority': 5, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Spelling or typo error', 'kc_id': 'kc_004', 'evidence': 'In past times, when there was some big celebration upcoming, it <error>tooked</error> so much effort to make everything from scratch as there was no local stores.', 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'Article usage error', 'kc_id': 'kc_005', 'evidence': ""This has enriched the communal activities in societies and has also enhanced quality of <error>a human's</error> life."", 'priority': 2, 'category': 'language'}, {'description': 'No overall conclusion', 'kc_id': 'kc_006', 'evidence': 'In conclusion, supermarkets have definitely improved our daily life and community.', 'priority': 4, 'category': 'organization'}]",1759584295641,high-uptake

[End of passage, due to timeout]","Recently, there emerges an new challenge on if to reduce school days, from five to four days a week. Through this new approach, students might study from Monday to Thursday or from Tuesday to Friday, otherwise, you could choose which day to have off during the weekdays. It is a major trend from well-known educational institutions in some areas of United States, in the direction of lowering school hours and enhancing performance of each student. The main factor for the growing curiosity in Japan is the announcement of present (21st) Japanese prime minister, Suzuki Kaito, for incorporating his plans for the prime minister election happening this year.

He declared that during his tenure, he will provide a revision of school time into 4-day school week ultimately, and would be started the shift into 4.5-day school week — Mon. to Thurs. are unchanged, and end a school week at midday, on Friday — until the next year. His keypoint was that there will be no reduction of education quality, so he was opposed and criticized from many educators and authorities in education.

But however, I believe it is not the most critical aspect of these discussions to simply select between 4-day and 5-day. In my view, school week needs to be aligned with considering each school's condition, and the flexibility of such alignment has to be allowed to educators within some given limits.

Here's one reason; the ideal way for teaching strongly relies on circumstances. Academic institutions, which still provides over a half of total educational value in Japan, has the feature that more studying generally ensures more success and achievements. 5-day school week would be ideal for most schools in these systems.

Still, extra study would cause some mental & physical problems for high schoolers or elementary students.

First, robotics can increase efficiency in production processes. It allows factories to produce more products in a shorter time. And it even makes production more precise by reducing error rates. That is, robotics can bring us benefits by increasing productivity in various industries.

Second, robotics is closely linked with innovation. Innovation improves quality of life by providing new solutions. It helps countries develop technologies that improve people's daily life. Then, robotics provide us with new tools that make life easier.

Lastly, robotics offers a broader perspective on the future. With robotics, people can explore new possibilities. In this journey, people learn and share new technologies with other people from different backgrounds than us. And it opens up our world to new ideas.

Second, the reading proposes relocating the Torreya tree to a colder region in the north, assuming that it may thrive in such a climate. The professor counters this by citing the example of the black locust tree, which grew excessively and caused damage to the local ecosystem after being moved to a new area.
Finally, the reading recommends cultivating the Torreya tree in research centers which enables scientists to protect and study it. Nevertheless, the professor argues that trees grown in controlled environments tend to lose their natural resistance to diseases. Furthermore, replicating the extensive and diverse conditions required for the tree’s survival in the wild is highly challenging.
In conclusion, current research team should try its best to find a solution to prevent the extinction of Torreya tree.","The sightseeing of city has various aspects that attracts tourists all year round. Nevertheless, the traveler in the documentary disagrees with all the main attractions listed and explains reasons why they do not meet expectations. Initially, the narrator highlights the city park as a main feature that visitors must not miss. However the traveler claims visiting the park does not offer unique experience because the park is often overcrowded. Additionally, they suggests visiting the local museums as excellent way to learn about local history. The traveler, conversely, recalls an instance where the exhibits were underwhelming and same as other places. Lastly, the narrator recommends tasting food from the street vendors, ensuring a rich culinary adventure. Still, the traveler argues that street food often lacks authenticity and is tailored to tourists, losing its cultural essence.

When trying a new sport, individuals can find parts of their body they didn't know were strong. Experiencing different games can help people understand that body has many capabilities and is worth exploring. Second, people learn teamwork. In many sports, cooperating is crucial. Some games require passing constantly, others need synchronized movement, and the other involve strategy. Although all these sports have own benefits and challenges, playing different sports help people develop new skills. While playing, people must think and react quickly. Finally, people can meet new friends. Players meet others who have diverse backgrounds and ideas.

So, today, I will explain why learning a new language has advantages. Now, I'll give more specifics. To start with, speaking more than one language can makes you smarter. When people use dual language, their brains get exercised. Think about when you was young and learn your first language. Was it not challenging, but rewarding? It same as learning a new one. Never give up and keep trying for better results. Secondly, knowing another language can open doors in career. Job opportunities often requires bilingual skills. Companies see these as assets.
